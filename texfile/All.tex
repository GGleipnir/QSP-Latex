\section{General Introduction}


We begin with a simple math problem.

Suppose that an operator $a$ satisfy the relation:

\[\left[a,\,a^{\dagger}\right] = 1 \]

The problem is to find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator $a^{\dagger}a$.

We first note that all the eigenvalues are positive.

If $|\alpha\rangle$ is a normalized eigenvector,

\[a^{\dagger}a|\alpha\rangle = \alpha|\alpha\rangle \]

its eigenvalue $\alpha$ is always positive

\[\alpha = \langle\alpha| a^{\dagger}a|\alpha\rangle = ||a|\alpha\rangle||^2 \ge 0 \]

We next note that

\[\begin{split}
&\left[a^{\dagger}a,\,a\right] = \left[a^{\dagger},\, a\right]a = -a \\
&\left[a^{\dagger}a,\,a^{\dagger}\right] = a^{\dagger}\left[a,\,a^{\dagger}\right] = a^{\dagger}
\end{split} \]

For this, we see that $a|\alpha\rangle$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\alpha - 1$

\[\begin{split}
(a^{\dagger}a)\,a|\alpha\rangle &= \left(aa^{\dagger}a -a\right)|\alpha\rangle \\
&=(\alpha - 1)a|\alpha\rangle
\end{split}\]

Similar, $a^{\dagger}|\alpha\rangle$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\alpha + 1$

\[\begin{split}
(a^{\dagger}a)\,a^{\dagger}|\alpha\rangle &= \left(a^{\dagger}a^{\dagger}a -a^{\dagger}\right)|\alpha\rangle \\
&=(\alpha + 1)a^{\dagger}|\alpha\rangle
\end{split}\]

The norm of $a|\alpha\rangle$ is $\alpha$,

\[||a|\alpha\rangle||^2 = \langle\alpha|a^{\dagger}a|\alpha\rangle = \alpha \]

Similar,

\[||a^{\dagger}|\alpha\rangle||^2 = \langle\alpha|aa^{\dagger}|\alpha\rangle = \alpha + 1 \]

By repeating application of $a$ `$n$' times, we can produce an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\alpha - n$.

\[a^{\dagger}a a^n|\alpha\rangle = (\alpha - n)a^n|\alpha\rangle \]

But, when $n$ becomes larger than $\alpha$, the eigenvalue becomes negative, which contradicts the non-negativeness of eigenvalues of $a^{\dagger}a$.

This means that a given $|\alpha\rangle$ has some integer `$n$', which satisfies

\[a^n|\alpha\rangle \neq 0,\quad a^{n+1}|\alpha\rangle = 0 \]

The latter equation means

\[\begin{split}
0 &= \langle\alpha|(a^{\dagger})^n \cdot a^{\dagger}a\cdot a^n|\alpha\rangle\\
&=(\alpha - n)\langle\alpha|(a^{\dagger})^n a^n|\alpha\rangle
\end{split} \]

The former means that this:

\[\langle\alpha|(a^{\dagger})^n a^n|\alpha\rangle \]

is not zero.

Thus, $\alpha = n$.

This shows that the eigenvalues of $a^{\dagger}a$ must be non-negative integers and there is a ``vacuum state'' $|0\rangle$ such that

\[a|0\rangle = 0 \]

By repeatedly applying $a^{\dagger}$ to vacuum state, we see that $(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $n$.

\[a^{\dagger}a(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle = n(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle \]

The norm of this eigenvector is the factorial of $n$.

\[\begin{split}
\langle 0|(a)^n(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle &=  \langle 0|a^{n-1}\cdot \underset{1+a^{\dagger}a}{aa^{\dagger}}\cdot(a^{\dagger})^{n-1}|0\rangle\\
&= (n-1+1)\cdot\langle 0|(a)^{n-1}(a^{\dagger})^{n-1}|0\rangle\\
&= n\cdot(n-1)\cdot\langle 0|(a)^{n-2}(a^{\dagger})^{n-2}|0\rangle\\
&= n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots 2 \langle 0|aa^{\dagger}|0\rangle = n!
\end{split}\]

The normalized eigenvector with eigenvalue `$n$' is

\begin{equation}
|n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle
\end{equation}

with this definition, the $|n\rangle$ are orthonormal and satisfy:

\begin{equation}\label{1.1.2}
a^{\dagger}|n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{1.1.3}
\begin{split}
a|n\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}a(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}(a^{\dagger}a+1)(a^{\dagger})^{n-1}|0\rangle\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}n(a^{\dagger})^{n-1}|0\rangle\\
&=\sqrt{n}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{(n-1)!}}(a^{\dagger})^{n-1}|0\rangle\\
&=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\[a^{\dagger}a|n\rangle = n|n\rangle \]

The operator $a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ are called ``rasing'' and ``lowering'' operators respectively, because the raise and lower the eigenvalue or $a^{\dagger}a$.
In the later application, $a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ are called ``creation'' and ``annihilation'' operators respectively.

You might be afraid that the ground state ``$|0\rangle$'' is not necessarily unique, so that the state do not exhaust all the possible eigenstates of $a^{\dagger}a$.

\[|0\rangle_1\underset{\rightarrow b}{,\ |}0\rangle_2,\ |0\rangle_3,\ \cdots \]

In such a case, however, we can define some other operators, which commute $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ and which connect the ground states.

Thus, we can further classify these ground states according to the eigenvalues of these other operators\footnote{like:
\[\begin{split}|n\rangle|\beta\rangle &\overset{def}{\equiv}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}(a^{\dagger})^n|0\rangle|\beta\rangle \\
b|\beta\rangle &= \beta|\beta\rangle
\end{split}\]}.



\section{Linear Harmonic Oscillator}


Our first application of the general argument is a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator which has a Hamiltonian as this form:

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{p^2}{2m}+\frac{m\omega^2}{2m}x^2
\end{equation}

$x$ and $p$ are the position and the momentum operator of a particle whose mass is `$m$'.

$x,\ p$ satisfies

\[[x, p] = i\hbar \]

\[\begin{split}
H &= \frac{\hbar\omega}{2}\left[\frac{p^2}{m\omega\hbar}+\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}x^2\right]\\
&\equiv\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}[P^2+X^2]
\end{split} \]

\[[X, P] = i \]

By factorizing an energy unit, the Hamiltonian has a quadratic form of these two dimensionless quantities. 

They satisfy this commutation relation. 

In terms of these two hermitian operators, let us define a following non-hermitian operator:

\[a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[X+iP] \]
\[a^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[X-iP] \]

Frin this, we see

\[[a,a^\dagger] = 1 \]

while the Hamiltonian takes this form:

\[\begin{split}
H &= \frac{\hbar\omega}{2}\left[\frac{1}{2}(X-iP)(X+iP)+\frac{1}{2}(X+iP)(X-iP)\right]\\
&=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}[a^\dagger a+a a^\dagger]\\
&=\hbar\omega\left[a^\dagger a+\frac{1}{2}\right]
\end{split} \]

Now we know how to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $a^\dagger a$ for any given non-hermitian operator $a$. 

Thus, the eigen energy of $H$ is given by this

\[H|n\rangle = \hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)|n\rangle \]

while the eigenstate $|n\rangle$ is obtained from a repeated application of the operator $a$ onto the `ground state'. 

The ground state $|0\rangle$ satisfies this, 

\[a|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[XD+i\left(-i\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\right)\right]|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[X+\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\right]|0\rangle = 0 \]

\[|0\rangle = \frac{1}{N}e^{-X^2/2} \]

Thus, the eigenstate with eigen energy $(n+1/2)$ takes this form

\[|n\rangle \propto \left(X-\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\right)^n e^{-\frac{X^2}{2}} = e^{-\frac{X^2}{2}}\times\text{ Hermite polynominals} \]

which is expressed in terms of Herminite polynominal with integer index $n$. 




\section{Many Harmonic Oscillator}

Our next application is a system of many harmonic oscillators, which consists of many particles with different mass. 

\begin{align}
H = \sum_i \frac{1}{2m_i}P_i^2+\sum_{i,j}V_{ij}Q_iQ_j
\end{align}

where $Q_i$ and $P_i$ are canonical coordinates and momenta

\[\begin{cases}
[Q_i,Q_j] = [P_i,P_j] = 0\\
\ \\
[Q_i,P_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}
\end{cases}\]

Since these two momentum operators can be exchanged freely, we can regard that $V_{ij}$ is real symmetric

\[V_{ij} = V_{ji}\text{ real } \]

We normalize these coordinates and momenta by differen mass

\[q_i \equiv\sqrt{m_i}Q_i,\ p_i \equiv \frac{P_i}{\sqrt{m_i}} \]

\[H = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}p_i^2+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}v_{ij}q_iq_j \]

\[(v_{ij} \equiv \frac{V_{ij}}{\sqrt{m_jm_j}} )\]

To obtain eigenstates and eigen energy of $H$, we first diagonalize this real symmetric matrix by an orthogonal matrix. 

\[\mathbb{C}^T \mathbb{V}\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{W} \]

We assume that eigenvalues of $\mathbb{V}$ are all positive

\[c_{\alpha_i}c_{\beta_j}v_{ij} = \omega_{\alpha}^2\delta_{\alpha\beta} \]

In terms of this new basis, the Hamiltonian takes the following form:

\[H = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha}(\tilde{p}_{\alpha}^2+\omega_{\alpha}^2\tilde{q}_{\alpha}^2 \]

where $\tilde{p}_{\alpha}$ and $\tilde{q}_{\alpha}$ are canonical momenta and coordinates:

\[\tilde{q}_{\alpha}\equiv \sum_i c_{\alpha_i}q_i \]
\[\tilde{p}_{\alpha}\equiv \sum_i c_{\alpha_i}p_i \]

\[[\tilde{q}_{\alpha},\tilde{q}_{\beta}] = [\tilde{p}_{\alpha},\tilde{p}_{\beta}] = 0 \]
\[[\tilde{q}_{\alpha},\tilde{p}_{\beta}] = i\hbar\delta_{\alpha\beta} \]

Thanks to the basis change, we have a system of decouple linear harmonic oscillators, each of which can be separately solved. 

Namely, we form lowering and raising operators for each mode:

\[a_{\alpha} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\hbar}}\left[\sqrt{\omega_{\alpha}}\tilde{q}_{\alpha}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_{\alpha}}}\tilde{p}_{\alpha}\right] \]
\[a_{\alpha}^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\hbar}}\left[\sqrt{\omega_{\alpha}}\tilde{q}_{\alpha}-\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_{\alpha}}}\tilde{p}_{\alpha}\right] \]

which satisfy

\begin{align}\label{Eqs1.3.2}
\begin{split}
[a_{\alpha},a_{\beta}] & = [a_\alpha^\dagger, a_\beta^\dagger] = 0\\
[a_\alpha,a_\beta^\dagger] &= \delta_{\alpha\beta}
\end{split}
\end{align}

and

\[H = \sum_\alpha \hbar\omega_\alpha(a^\dagger_\alpha a_\alpha + \frac{1}{2}) \]

The eigenstates of $H$ are described by a set of non-negative integers defined fro each decoupled mode. 

\[H|n_1,n_2,\cdots\rangle = \sum_\alpha \hbar\omega_\alpha(n_\alpha+\frac{1}{2})|n_1,n_2\cdots\rangle \]

The integer for a mode $\alpha,n_\alpha$, is an eigenvalue of $a^\dagger_\alpha a_\alpha$. 

\[\text{for }\forall \alpha,\quad a^\dagger_\alpha a_\alpha = |n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_\alpha,\cdots\rangle = n_\alpha|n_1,n_2\cdots,n_\alpha,\cdots\rangle \]

These eigenstates can be constructed for the `ground state'

\[|n_1,n_2,\cdots\rangle = \left[\prod_\alpha\frac{(a^\dagger_\alpha)^{n_\alpha}}{\sqrt{n_\alpha !}}\right]|0.0,\cdots\rangle \]

where the ground state is defined by

\[a_\alpha|0,0,\cdots\rangle = 0, \text{ for }\forall \alpha \]

Corresponding to \eqref{1.1.2} and \eqref{1.1.3}, we have

%\begin{align}
\begin{numcases}{}
a_\alpha^\dagger|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_\alpha,\cdots\rangle = \sqrt{n_\alpha+1}|n_1,n_2,\cdots, n_\alpha+1,\cdots\rangle\label{Eqs1.3.3}\\
a_\alpha|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_\alpha,\cdots\rangle = \sqrt{n_\alpha}|n_1,n_2,\cdots, n_\alpha-1,\cdots\rangle\label{Eqs1.3.4}
\end{numcases}
%\end{align}


\section{Field Quantization}

Our final application is a system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. 

The system is described by what we call a `field' $\phi_x$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width = 10cm]{1-1.png}
\end{figure}

An example of the system is a drumhead vibration. Here is a picture of drum:

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{1-2.png}
\end{figure}

Every spatial point in the drumhead can have a finite displacement poerpendicular to the flat drumhead. 

We can define $\varphi$ of $x$ ($\varphi(x)$) as a dispalcement at $x$ point. 

Namely, a given $\varphi$ of $x$ specifies how the drumhead is deformed from the flat drum head. 

Let us consider $\varphi$ of $x$ whose motion is described by the following Lagragian

\begin{align}
L(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2}\int d^2 x\dot{\varphi}(x)\dot{\varphi}(x) - \frac{1}{2}\int d^2 x \int d^2 x' K(x-x')\varphi(x)\varphi(x')\text{ with }K(x-x') = K(x'-x)
\end{align}

The corresponding equation of motion is

\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\delta L}{\delta \dot{\varphi}(x)} - \frac{\delta\dot{L}}{\delta \varphi(x)} = \ddot{\varphi}(x)+\int d^2 x' K(x-x')\varphi(x')
\end{equation}

When the interaction between fields is spatially local like this

\[K(x-x') = -c^2\Delta^2\delta(x-x'), \]

the equation of motion becomes the usual wave equation

\[\nabla^2\varphi(x) - \frac{1}{c^2}\ddot{\varphi}(x) = 0 \]

\hrule

\ 

If we regard that $\varphi(x)$ is a coordinate variable for each $x$, the conjugate momentu to $\varphi$ is

\[\Pi(x) = \frac{\delta L}{\delta \dot{\varphi}(x)} = \dot{\varphi}(x) \]

The Hamiltonian is then 

\begin{align}
H = \int d^2 x \Pi(x) \dot{\varphi}(x) - L = \frac{1}{2}\int d^2 x \Pi(x)\Pi(x)+\frac{1}{2}\int d^2 x \int d^2 x' K(x-x') \varphi(x)\varphi(x')
\end{align}

To quantize the system, we suppose that $\varphi(x)$ and $\Pi(x)$ are Hermitian operators, which satisfy

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
[\varphi(x),\varphi(x')] &= [\Pi(x),\Pi(x')] = 0\\
[\varphi(x),\Pi(\varphi')] &= i\hbar\delta^2(x-x')
\end{split}
\end{align}

In such a case, it is helpful to express the field in the momentum representation, 

\[\tilde{\varphi}(k) = \int d^2 x\varphi(x)e^{-ikx} \]

\[\tilde{\Pi}(x) = \int d^2 x \Pi(x) e^{-ikx} \]

where the inverse transformation is 

\[\varphi(x) = \int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2} \tilde{\varphi}(k)e^{ikx} \]

with

\begin{align}
\int \frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}e^{-ikx} = \delta^2(x)
\end{align}

Since $\varphi(x)$ and $\Pi(x)$ are hermitian, we have

\[\varphi^\dagger(k) = \varphi(-k) \]

\[\Pi^\dagger(k) = \Pi(-k) \]

The commutation relations are

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
[\tilde{\varphi}(k), \tilde{\varphi}(k')] &= [\tilde{\Pi}(k), \tilde{\Pi}(k')] = 0\\
[\tilde{\varphi}(k),\tilde{\Pi}(k')] &= i\hbar(2\pi)^2\delta^2(k+k')
\end{split}
\end{align}

Now let us introduce 

\[\omega^2(k) = \int d^2x K(x)e^{-ikx} \]

Since $K(x) = K(-x)$, $\omega(k)$ is real and even function in $k$. 

\[\omega^*(k) = \omega(k) = \omega(-k) \]

Let uis again assume that $\omega(k)$ are non-negative for all $k$, so that we replace this by $\omega^2(k)$. 

Rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of these fields and functions, we obtain

\begin{align}
H = \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\left[\tilde{\Pi}(-k)\tilde(k)+\omega^2(k)\tilde{\varphi}(-k)\tilde{\varphi}(k)\right] = \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\left[\tilde{\Pi}^\dagger (k)\tilde(k)+\omega^2(k)\tilde{\varphi}^\dagger(k)\tilde{\varphi}(k)\right]
\end{align}

We next define annihilation and creation operators as follows, 

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
a(k) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\sqrt{\frac{\omega(k)}{\hbar}}\tilde{\varphi}(k)+\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega(k)\hbar}}\tilde{\Pi}(k)\right]\\
a^\dagger(k) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\sqrt{\frac{\omega(k)}{\hbar}}\tilde{\varphi}(k)-\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega(k)\hbar}}\tilde{\Pi}(k)\right]
\end{split}
\end{align}

Their commutation relations are calculated as follows, 

\[\begin{split}
[a(k),a(k')] &= \frac{1}{2\hbar}\left[\sqrt{\omega_k}\tilde{\varphi}(k)+\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_k}} \tilde{\Pi}(k), \sqrt{\omega_{k'}}\tilde{\varphi}(k')+\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_{k'}}}\tilde{\Pi}(k')\right] \\
&= \frac{1}{2\hbar}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_{k'}}}i[\tilde{\varphi}(k),\tilde{\Pi}(k')] + \frac{1}{2\hbar}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{k'}}{\omega_k}}i[\tilde{\Pi}(k),\tilde{\varphi}(k')] \\
&=(-1)(2\pi)^2\delta^2(k+k')+(2\pi)^2\delta^2(k+k')= 0 
\end{split}\]

\[[a^\dagger(k),a^\dagger(k')] = 0 \]

\begin{align}\begin{split}
[a(k),a^\dagger(k')] &= \frac{1}{2\hbar}\left[\sqrt{\omega_k}\tilde{\varphi}(k)+\frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_k}}, \sqrt{\omega_{k'}}\tilde{\varphi}(-k') - \frac{i}{\sqrt{\omega_{k'}}}\tilde{\Pi}(-k')\right] \\
&= \frac{-i}{2\hbar}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_{k'}}} [\tilde{\varphi}(k),\tilde{\Pi}(-k')] + \frac{i}{2\hbar}[\tilde{\Pi}(k),\tilde{\varphi}(-k')] \\
&= (2\pi)^2\delta^2(k-k')
\end{split}\end{align}

If we wrtie $H$ in terms of $a \& a^\dagger$, we obtain

\begin{align}
H = \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\hbar\omega(k)[a^\dagger(k)a(k)+a(k)a^\dagger(k)] = \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\hbar\omega(k)a^\dagger(k)a(k)+C
\end{align}

Thus, eigenstate of $H$ is given by the repeated application of $a^\dagger(k)$ onto the ground state\footnote{Regarding these energy units as particles respectively, we can think of these excited states as one-particle state, two-particle state, and so on. }

\[|k_1\rangle = a^\dagger(k_1)|0\rangle,\quad (E=\omega(k_1)) \]
\[|k_1,k_2\rangle = a^\dagger(k_1)a^\dagger(k_2)|0\rangle,\quad (E=\omega(k_1)+\omega(k_2)) \]

while the ground state satisfies

\[a(k)|0\rangle = 0,\quad\text{for}\forall k \]

To characterize these multi-particle states, let us consider the following operators, 

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P} \equiv\int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\hbar{k}a^\dagger({k})a({k})
\end{align}

which satisfies

\[[\mathbb{P},a^\dagger({k})] = \hbar {k}a^\dagger(k) \]
\[[\mathbb{P},a(k)] = -\hbar ka(k) \]

so that

\[\begin{split}
\mathbb{P}|k_1,k_2,\cdots\rangle &= \mathbb{P}a^\dagger(k_1)a^\dagger(k_2)\cdots|0\rangle  = a^\dagger(k_1)(\hbar k_1+\mathbb{P})a^\dagger(k_2)\cdots|0\rangle\\
&= \hbar k_1 |k_1,k_2,\cdots\rangle + a^\dagger(k_1)\mathbb{P}a^\dagger(k_2)\cdots|0\rangle\\
&= \hbar k_1|k_1,k_2,\cdots\rangle + a^\dagger(k_1)a^\dagger(k_2)(\hbar k_2+\mathbb{P})\cdots|0\rangle\\
&=\cdots\\
&=\hbar(k_1+k_2+\cdots)|k_1,k_2,\cdots\rangle
\end{split}\]

we can also see that

\[\begin{split}
[\mathbb{P},\varphi(x)] &= \left[\mathbb{P},\int\frac{d^2k}{(2\pi)^2}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2\omega(k)}}\left(a(k)e^{ik\cdot x}+a^\dagger(k)e^{-ik\cdot x}\right)\right]\\
&= \int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2\omega(k)}}\left\{(-\hbar k)a(k)e^{ik\cdot x}+(\hbar k)a^\dagger(k)e^{-ik\cdot x}\right\}\\
&= i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left\{\int\frac{d^2 k}{(2\pi)^2}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2\omega(k)}}\left(a(k)e^{ik\cdot x}+a^\dagger(k)e^{-ik\cdot x}\right)\right\}\\
&=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\varphi(x)
\end{split}\]

Similarly

\[[\mathbb{P},\Pi(x)] = i\hbar\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Pi(x) \]

Using these relations, one can show that 

\[e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar} = \varphi(x+a) \]
\[e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\Pi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar} = \Pi(x+a) \]

Namely, taking a derivative of r.h.s with respect to $a$, we have

\[\begin{split}
\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\left[e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\right]&=\frac{1}{i\hbar}e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}[\mathbb{P},\varphi(x)]e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\\
&= e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\\
&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left\{e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\right\}
\end{split}\]

This means that

\[e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar} = f(x+a) \]

while $f$ should be $\phi$ when $a=0$, thus we have

\begin{align}
e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\varphi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar} = \varphi(x+a)
\end{align}

Similar we have

\[e^{a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar}\Pi(x)e^{-a\cdot\mathbb{P}/i\hbar} = \Pi(x+a)
\]

These two relations means that $\mathbb{P}$ is a generator of the spatial translation and is therefore the momentum operator. 


\section{System of indistinguishable particles}

In the preceding sections, we consider the quantum states of an oscillator  system as multiparticle states, where each particle has an energy unit and is often called a ``phonon''. In this section, we follow a different line of reasoning. We will start with a space of states describing a single particle, which is either Bose particle or Fermi particle. We then construct the multiple-particle states based on standard methods. 

For the Bose particle case, we will arrive at a system of states and operators, that is mathematically equivalent to that found previously for a systen of oscillators. Thereby, this shows that the interpretation of oscillator states as many-phonon states is consistent with the usual description of many-particle systems with Bose statistics. 

We will develop a formalism with Fermi-Dirac statistics, for which the states do not resemble those of a harmonic-oscillator system. 

Consider first the case of distinguishable particles. 

A $n$-particle state is given by a simple product of one-particle states

\[|\psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle|\psi_2\rangle\cdots|\psi_n\rangle \]

You can also weite this in the coordinate representation as 

\[\psi(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = \psi_1(x_1)\psi_2(x_2)\cdots\psi_n(x_n) \]

where $x_j$ denotes the coordinate of $j$-th particle and $\langle x_j|\psi_j\rangle = \psi_j(x_j)$. 

Please notice that these $n$-particles are all distinguishable from one another. 

Namely, each particle has its own coordinate $x$, and we can distinguish $j$-th particle from $m$-th particle, because they belong to different one-particle states

\[\psi_j(x) \neq \psi_m(x),\quad \text{for }j\neq m \]

\hrule

\ 

Let us next consider indistinguishable particles. 

To make up a many-particle wavefunction for indistinguishable particles out of this, we need to make any pair of particles cannot be distinguished from each other. 

There is two-ways of doing this, one way is to ``symmetrize'' this with respect to all the possible permutations of $n$ particles:

\[\psi_1(x_1)\cdot\psi_2(x_2)\cdot\cdots\cdot\psi_n(x_n)\overset{\text{``symmetrize''}}{\longrightarrow}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}\sum_P \psi_{P(1)}(x_1)\cdot\psi_{P(2)}(x_2)\cdot\cdots\cdot\psi_{P(n)}(x_n) \]

Here $P$ denotes a permutation among $n$ numbers, $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$

\[P \equiv\left(
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & \cdots & n\\
P(1) & P(2) & \cdots & P(n)
\end{matrix}
\right) \]

into $\{P(1),P(2),\cdots P(n)\}$

we take the sum over all possible permutations here. 

The total number of possible permutations among $n$ distinguishable objects are given by a factorial of $n$. To normalize this many-particle wavefunction, I put $1$ over the square root of the factorial of $n$. We can see that the exchange between the $j$-th particle coordinate and the $m$-th particle coordinate does not change this many-particle wavefunction. 

\[\begin{split}
\psi(x_2,x_1,x_3,\cdots x_n) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}\sum_P\psi_{P(1)}(x_2)\psi_{P(1)}(x_2)\psi_{P(3)}(x_3)\cdots\psi_{(P(n)}(x_n)\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_P\psi_{P(1)}(x_2)\psi_{P(1)}(x_2)\psi_{P(3)}(x_3)\cdots\psi_{(P(n)}(x_n)\\
\Big\{P' &= P\cdot\left(
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & \cdots & n\\
2 & 1 & 3 & \cdots & n
\end{matrix}\right)\Big\}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{P'}\psi_{P'(1)}(x_1)\psi_{P'(2)}(x_2)\psi_{P'(3)}(x_3)\cdots\psi_{P'(n)}(x_n)\\
&= \psi(x_1,x_2,x_3,\cdots, x_n)
\end{split}\]

Here $P'$ is a product between a permutation $P$ and the permutation which exchange $1$ and $2$, while remains other indices intact. 

This product can be regarded as a mapping from $P$ to $P'$ and this mapping is one-to-one mapping. 

Namely, a set of all possible permutations is unchanged under that mapping. 

Therefore, the right hand side is identical to the original wavefunctions. 

This argument so far holds true not only for the exchange between arbitrary pair of two particles but also for an arbitrary permutations among $n$ particles. 

\[\psi(x_{Q(1)},x_{Q(2)},\cdots,x_{Q(n)}) = \cdots=\psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n) \]

Because of this symmetrized property, $n$-particles in this wavefunction are indistinguishable from one another. 

An indistinguishable particle in a symmetrized many-particle wavefunction is called as ``boson''. 

The other way of making wavefunctions for indistinguishable particles is ``antesymmetrize'' the wavefunction for distinguishable particles. %page41




\section{Creation operator \& destruction operator}

So far, we have constructed a complete orthonormal set of states in the multiparticle space. With these constructions in hand, we are now ready to define creation and destruction operators. These operators change the number of particles, so that they connect states of different numbers of particles. We will see that allthe physical operators are expressed in terms of creation and destruction operators. 

Let $|\varphi\rangle$ be any one-particle state. We define $a^\dagger$ of $\varphi$ to be that linear operator which satisfies this, for any n-particle states $|\psi_1, \cdots,\psi_n\rangle$. 

\begin{align}
a^\dagger{\varphi}|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle = |\varphi,\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \tag{e}\\
\quad\text{for any}|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \label{Eqs1.6.1}
\end{align}

For $n=0$, this simply means that

\[a^\dagger(\varphi)|vac\rangle = |\varphi\rangle \]

We call $a^\dagger(\varphi)$ as the creation operator for the state $|\varphi\rangle$, and its hermitian conjugate $a(\varphi)$ as the destruction or annihilation operator. 

A destruction operator converts an $n$-particle states into a $(n-1)$-particle states. 

To find the effect of $a(\varphi)$ on an $n$-particle state $|\psi_1,\psi_2,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle$, we multiply on the left by an arbitrary $(n-1)$-particle state, which is this

\[\begin{split}
&\langle x_1,\cdots,x_{n-1}|a(\varphi)|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \\
&= (\langle \psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n|a^\dagger(\varphi)|x_1,\cdots,x_{n-1}\rangle)^*\\
&= (\langle \psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n|\varphi,x_1,\cdots,x_{n-1}\rangle)^*\\
&= 
\begin{vmatrix}
\langle\psi_1|\phi\rangle & \langle\psi_1|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_1|x_{n-1}\rangle\\
\langle\psi_2|\phi\rangle & \langle\psi_2|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_2|x_{n-1}\rangle\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
\langle\psi_n|\phi\rangle & \langle\psi_n|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_n|x_{n-1}\rangle
\end{vmatrix}_{\xi}^*\\
&= \left\{\sum_{k=1}^n \xi^{k-1}\langle\psi_k|\varphi\rangle
\begin{vmatrix}
 \langle\psi_1|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_1|x_{n-1}\rangle\\
 \langle\psi_2|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_2|x_{n-1}\rangle\\
 \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
 \langle\psi_n|x_1\rangle & \cdots & \langle\psi_n|x_{n-1}\rangle
\end{vmatrix}_{\xi} \right\}^*\\
&= \sum_{k=1}^n \xi^{k-1}\langle\varphi|\psi_k\rangle\langle x_1,\cdots,x_{n-1}|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{k-1},\psi_{k+1},\cdots,\psi_n\rangle
\end{split}\]

Since this relation holds true for any arbitrary $x_1$ and so on, we finally have

\begin{align}\label{Eqs1.6.2}a(\varphi)|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n \xi^{k-1}\langle \varphi|\psi_k\rangle |\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{k-1},\psi_{k+1},\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \end{align}


We can derive 

\[a^\dagger(\varphi_1)a^\dagger(\varphi_2) = \xi a^\dagger(\varphi_2)a^\dagger(\varphi) \]

Namely, the following relations holds true for arbitrary $\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n$

\[a^\dagger(\varphi_1)a^\dagger(\varphi_2)|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle = \xi a^\dagger(\varphi_2)a^\dagger(\varphi) |\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle\]

This leads to the commutation relations for boson and fermion. 

\begin{align}
[a^\dagger(\varphi_1),a^\dagger(\varphi_2)]_{-\xi} = 0
\end{align}

where

\[[A,B]_{-\xi} = AB - \xi BA = \begin{cases}AB-BA\ \text{boson}\\ \ \\ AB+BA \ \text{fermion}\end{cases}\]

Taking the hermite conjugate of this, we have

\begin{align}
[a(\varphi_1),a(\varphi_2)]_{-\xi} = 0
\end{align}

\hrule

\ 

To find the commutation relations between the creation operator and destruction operator, we first calculate 

\[\begin{split}
&a(\varphi_1)a^\dagger(\varphi_2)|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \\
&=a(\varphi_1)|\varphi_2,\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle\\
&= \langle\varphi_1|\varphi_2\rangle|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle + \sum_{k=1}^n\xi^k\langle\varphi_1|\psi_k\rangle|\varphi_2,\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{k-1},\psi_{k+1},\cdots,\psi_n\rangle
\end{split}\]

and

\[\begin{split}
&a^\dagger(\varphi_2)a(\varphi_1)|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^n\xi^{k-1}\langle \varphi_1|\psi_k\rangle a^\dagger(\varphi_2)|\psi_k\rangle|\varphi_2,\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{k-1},\psi_{k+1},\cdots,\psi_n\rangle\\
&= \sum_{k=1}^n\xi^{k-1}\langle \varphi_1|\psi_k\rangle |\varphi_2,\psi_k\rangle|\varphi_2,\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{k-1},\psi_{k+1},\cdots,\psi_n\rangle\\
\end{split}\]

Multiply this by $\xi$ and substract it from the former one, we see that

\[[a(\varphi_1)a^\dagger(\varphi_2) - \xi a^\dagger(\varphi_2)a(\varphi_2)]|\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle = \langle \varphi_1|\varphi_2\rangle |\psi_1,\cdots,\psi_n\rangle \]

Equivalently, we have

\begin{align}
[a(\varphi_1),a^\dagger(\varphi_2)] _{-\xi} = \langle\varphi_1|\varphi_2\rangle
\end{align}

These three relations are the fundamental ``commutation relations'' for creation \& destruction operators. When these operators are introduced in terms of an orthonormal basis, this relation becomes

\begin{align}
[a(\alpha),a^\dagger(\beta)]_{-\xi} = \langle\alpha|\beta\rangle = \delta_{\alpha\beta}
\end{align}

Where one-particle states $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|\beta\rangle$ are from a complete orthonormal set of one-particle states, $\{|1\rangle,|2\rangle,\cdots\}$

Let us next compare these commutation relations with raising and lowering operators for linear harmonic osciallators. 

For boson case, we further define an orthonormal basis for the multiparticle space as 

\begin{align}|n_1,n_2,\cdots\rangle = \frac{|\overset{n_1}{1,\cdots,1},\overset{n_2}{2,\cdots,2},\cdots\rangle}{\sqrt{n_1! n_2!,\cdots}} \end{align}

Where we use $\{|1\rangle,|2\rangle,\cdots\}$ as a complete orthonormal set of one-particle states and $n_{\alpha}$ is the number of times $\alpha$ appear in the ket state in the right hand side. In terms of this orthornormal basis, eqs \eqref{Eqs1.6.1}, \eqref{Eqs1.6.2} reduce to the followings:

\begin{align}
a^\dagger(\alpha)|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_{\alpha},\cdots\rangle = \sqrt{n_\alpha+1}|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_{\alpha}+1,\cdots\rangle\\
a(\alpha)|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_{\alpha},\cdots\rangle = \sqrt{n_\alpha}|n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_{\alpha}-1,\cdots\rangle
\end{align}

while the commutation relations are 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
[a(\alpha),a(\beta)] &= [a^\dagger(\alpha),a^\dagger(\beta)] = 0\\
[a(\alpha),a^\dagger(\beta)] &= \delta_{\alpha\beta}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

These three equations are identical to eqs \eqref{Eqs1.3.2}, \eqref{Eqs1.3.3}, \eqref{Eqs1.3.4}

This means that creation \& destruction operators for a system of Bose particles looks exactly like those for a system of linear harmonic oscillators. 

For fermions case, we have

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
a_\alpha^\dagger|\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\rangle &= |\alpha,\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\rangle\\
a_\alpha|\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\rangle &= \sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^{k-1}\delta_{\alpha\alpha_k}|\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_{k-1},\alpha_{k+1},\cdots,\alpha_n\rangle
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
[a_\alpha,a_\beta]_+ = [a_\alpha^\dagger,a_\beta^\dagger] = 0\\
[a_\alpha,a_\beta^\dagger]_+ = \delta_{\alpha\beta}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

Contrary to the boson case, there is no a priori reason for  postulating these anticommutation relations. These relations can be derived only from the antisymmetrization postulate for fermions. 

Let us put some remarks on these general commutation relations. 

One advantage of deriving them in such a general form is that we are not tied down to a particular basis of one-particle states. Suppose we use a basis of momentum eigenstates, $|\bf p\rangle$ with $\langle{\bf p}|{\bf p'}\rangle = (2\pi)^3\delta^3({\bf p}-{\bf p'})$. Then we have

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
[a({\bf p}),a^\dagger({\bf p'})]_{-\xi}&=(2\pi)^3\delta^3({\bf p}-{\bf p'})\\
[a({\bf p}), a({\bf p'})]_{-\xi} &= [a^\dagger({\bf p}),a^\dagger({\bf p'})]_{-\xi} = 0
\end{split}
\end{align}

A complete orthogonal sets of states in the multiparticle space can be constructed from the vacuum state 

\[|{\bf p_1},{\bf p_2},\cdots,{\bf p_n}\rangle = a^\dagger({\bf p_1})\cdots a^\dagger({\bf p_n})|vac\rangle \]

If we use a basis of position eigenstates $|\bf{x}\rangle$

In a usual metal, such as alkali metals of column I, outer shell valence electrons are completely separated from their ion cores and form a nearly free electron gas. 

In the section 1-8, we have treated the positively charged ion cores as temporally-static and uniformly-distributed positively-charged background. 

Thereby, the only play role of ensuring the electrical neutrality of the whole system. 

In this section, we will study the dynamics of the positively charged backgrounds, and their effect on the electron gas. 

In real metals, the ionic background form a lattice structure, so that it is not exactly the uniformly distributed positive charges. 

But, when it comes to the acoustic mode, in which all the ion cores are moving in the same `phase', the discreet lattice structure is irrelevant and we can treat them as a positively charged continuous elastic media. 

To describe the accoustic wave, let us first define a three-dimensional vector field $\bm d$ as a function of the spatial coordinate $\bm x$, which we call displacement vector:

\[\bm{d}(\bm{x}):\quad\text{displacement vector} \]

Physically, $\bm{d(x)}$ denotes how the ionic core at position $\bm x$ is displaced:

\[\bm{u(x) - \langle u(x)\rangle \equiv d(x)} \]

Compared to the displacement field $\varphi$ introduced in section 1-4, such a quantity is characterized by three component real-valued vector in a $3$-dimensional elastic media

\[\bm{d(x) = (d_1(x),d_2(x),d_3(x))} \]

According to the Helmholtz-Hodge's decomposition theorem, any vector field in $3$0dimensional space can be decomposed into divergence-free vector and a rotation-free vector

\[\bm{d(x)} = \nabla\phi + \nabla\times\vec{\bm{A}} \]

Although we always have ambiguity when decomposing into the two, let us temporally denote the rotation-free part as $\bm{d'(x)}$ and the divergence-free parts as $\bm{d''(x)}$ so that

\[\begin{cases}
\nabla\times\bm{d'} = 0\\
\nabla\cdot\bm{d''} = 0
\end{cases}\]

Corresponding to this decomposition, the acoustic waves are composed of two different kinds. 

One is called the longitudinal acoustic wave, which is described only by the rotation-free vector field $\bm{d'}$ (To be precise, $\nabla\cdot \bm{d'} = \nabla\cdot\bm{d}$): longitudinal(compressional) acoustic wave. 

The other is called the transverse acoustic waves, which are described only by the divergence-free part $\bm{d''}$ (to be precise, $\nabla\times\bm{d''} = \nabla\times\bm{d}$): transverse(shear) acoustic waves. 

$\nabla\cdot \vec{\bm{d}}$ is nothing but the charge density modulation in a positively charged background

\[\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}} = -\frac{\delta\rho_{inoic}}{\rho_0}\]

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{5.5cm}
\includegraphics[width = 5cm]{5-2.png}
\end{wrapfigure}
One can easily see this, by drawing a configuration of the displacement vector, which has a finite divergence. 

Namely, when these ionic charges are displaced like in this picture, we have effectively a negative charge in the middle. 

On the one hand, $\nabla\times\bm{d}$ is accompanied by the shear deformation in the positively charged ionic background, e.g.,

\begin{figure}
\end{figure}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{6.5cm}
\includegraphics[width = 6cm]{5-3.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

which is not accompanied by any charge density modulation. 

Since electrons and positively charged background are coupled with each other by electrostatic Coulomb interaction, we usually regard that the longitudinal acoustic waves are strongly coupled with electrons, while the transverse waves are not. 

For this reasoning, we will focus only on the longitudinal (compressional acoustic wave, where we enforce the displacement vector is rotation-free

\[\nabla\times\vec{\bm{d}}(\bm{x},t) = 0,\forall\bm{x},t \]

In order to introduce the equation of motion for the charge density modulation

\[\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}(\bm{x},t) = \delta\rho_{ion}(\bm{x},t) \]

Let us begin with the Newton's equation of motion for a fluid element

\[\frac{D\vec{p}}{Dt} = \vec{f} \]

Here $\bm{p}(\bm{x},t)$ is the momentum density field at position $\bm{x}$ at a given time $t$ which is given by a product between mass density field and velocity field

\[\bm{p}(\bm{x},t) = \rho(\bm{x},t)\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) \]

The temporal derivative in the right hand side is a Legendre derivative often used int the course of fluid mechanics. 

\[\frac{D\bm{p}}{Dt} \overset{def}{\equiv}\lim_{\Delta\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{\Delta t} \left\{\bm{p}(\bm{x}+\bm{v}\Delta t,t+\Delta t) - \bm{p}(\bm{x},t)\right\} = \frac{\partial\bm{p}}{\partial t}+(\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)\bm{p} \]

The force acting on the fluid element is a restoring force which comes from the spatial gradient of the pressure:

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\bm{v})+(\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)(\rho\bm{v}) = -\nabla P \]

In the equilibrium, we don't have any velocity field and the mass density is uniformly distributed and static

\[\left.\begin{split}
\rho(\bm{x},t) &= \rho_0\\
\ & \ \\
\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) &= 0
\end{split}\right\}\text{\quad equilibrium} \]

Out of the equilibrium, we have finite velocity field and mass density is spatially and temporally dependent:

\[\left.\begin{split}
\rho(\bm{x},t) &= \rho_0 + \delta\rho(\bm{x},t)\\
\ & \ \\
\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) &\neq 0
\end{split}\right\}\text{\quad out of equilibrium} \]

When linearizing this equation of motion for a small derivation from the equilibrium, we can regard that the $2^{\text{nd}}$ term in the right hand side is the $2^{\text{nd}}$ order in $\delta\rho$ and thus negligible:

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left((\rho_0+\delta\rho)\bm{v}\right) + (\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)\left((\rho_0+\delta\rho)\bm{v}\right) = -\nabla P \]

\[\rho_0\frac{\partial\bm{V}}{\partial t} + {\color{red}{O((\delta\rho)^2)}}= -\nabla p \]

,\footnote{The red part is omit-able. }

In addition to this Newton's equation of motion, the mass density field and velocity field must satisfy the continuity equation: 

\[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\bm{v}) = 0 \]

When linearized with respect to a small $\delta \rho$, we have

\[\frac{\partial\delta\rho}{\partial t} = -\rho_0(\nabla\cdot\bm{v}) \]

Combining these two linearized equation, we have

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\partial t^2}= -\rho_0(\nabla\cdot\frac{\partial\vec{\bm{v}}}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 P \]

A pressure of a given fluid element is determined by the mass density of the element, so that it is quite natural to assume that the pressure depends on the spatial coordinate $\bm{x}$ only through $\rho$. 

\[\nabla^2 P = \nabla^2 P(\rho_0+\delta\rho(\bm{x},t),\cdots) \approx\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)_{\rho_0}\nabla^2\delta\rho \]

This leads to the following closed equation of motion for the density fluctuation:

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\delta t^2} = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right)_{\rho_0}\nabla^2\delta\rho \]

For many elastic continuous media, we can define (adiabatic) bulk modulus. 

\[\begin{split}
B &= -B\left(\frac{\partial O}{\partial V}\right)_{equilibrium}\\
&\quad\quad \rho = \frac{M}{V},\ \quad \frac{d\rho}{dV} = M\left(-\frac{1}{V^2}\right)\\
&= -V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)M\left(-\frac{1}{V^2}\right)\\ &= \frac{M}{V}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right)_{eq} \overset{def}{\equiv}\rho_m\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)_{eq}
\end{split} \]

In terms of the bulk modulus, the coefficient of the right hand side is given by 

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\partial t^2} = \frac{B}{\rho_m}\cdot\nabla^2\delta\rho \equiv c^2\nabla^2\delta_\rho \]

Here $c$ is nothing but a velocity, with which the density fluctuation propagates in space as time passes by, and which is often called as the ``sound velocity'' of the longitudinal acoustic wave. 

As explained already, the density fluctuation is given by the divergence of the displacement field, the equation of motion for the displacement field is given by 

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}) = c^2\nabla^2(\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}) \]

\[\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{\partial \vec{\bm{d}}}{\partial t} - \nabla^2\vec{\bm{d}}\right) = 0 \]

Remember again that we are interested only in the longitudinal acoustic wave, so that the displacement field is rotation free at any space and time. 

\[\nabla\times\vec{\bm{d}} \equiv\vec{0} \]

The latter condition ensures that

\[\nabla\times\left(\frac{\partial \vec{\bm{d}}}{\partial t} - \nabla^2\vec{\bm{d}}\right) = 0\]

because $\nabla\times$ and $\partial_t$ or $\nabla^2$ commute with each other. 

From these two, we have a pair of equation which is satisfies by the displacement field $\bm{d}$. 

\[\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial\bm{d}}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla^2\bm{d} &= 0\\
\ &\ \\
\nabla\times\bm{d} &= 0
\end{cases}\]

So far, we just describing a classical equation of motion for the displacement field; in order to second-quantize this classical field, let us first introduce the Lagrangian which leads to this equation of motion:

\[L_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1,2,3}\int d^3\bm{x}\int dt\left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\right]\]

Notice that

\[\int \left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\right] = \delta L_0\]
\[\rho_m\delta d_i\left[\frac{\partial^2 d_i}{\partial t^2} - c^2\sum_{j = 1,2,3}\frac{\partial^2 d_i}{\partial x_j^2}\right] = \delta L_0 \]

Under the $2$nd condition of rotation-free, the Lagrangian can be rewritten into the following:

\[L_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\int d^3\bm{x}\int dt \left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial d_j}{\partial x_j}\right] (=\int dt \tilde{L}_0 \]

To see this, let us begin with the following identity:
\section{Electron-phonon interaction} \label{se5-2}

\chapter{Application to superconductivity}


In this chapter, we will study superconductivity which is one of the most remarkable physical phenomenon.

We first review the fundamental physical properties of superconductors.

We then introduce the BCS theory, which is one of the most successful application of quantum many-body techniques.

In terms of the BCS theory, we will see how all the fundamental superconducting properties can be understood from the microscopic point of views.



\section{Superconducting properties and thermodynamics relations}


Resistivity in metals decreases when the temperature goes down (See Fig{\ref{Fig6.1}}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{6-1.png}\label{Fig6.1}\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{6-2.png}\label{Fig6.2}
\caption{Resistivity $\rho$ vs. Temperature $T$ by $\rho = \rho_{res} + aT^2$ where `res' denotes residual resistivity. } \caption{Resistivity of superconductor's $\rho$ vs. Temperature $T$ by $\rho = \rho_{res} + aT^2$ where `res' denotes residual resistivity. } 
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The temperature dependence always exhibits $T^2$ behavior while the resistivity at the zero temperature remains finite, which we call residual resistivity $\rho_{res}$.
    
This residual resistivity stems from the scattering of conduction electron due to randomly distributed impurity and lattice defects. 
    
On the other hand, $T^2$-dependence of the resistivity comes from the scattering of conduction electrons due to electron-phonon interaction and electron-electron interactions. 
    
But, in some cases, metals exhibits an electronic phase transition at lower temperatures and resistivity becomes zero. 

The low-temperature phase with zero resistivity is called superconductor, or ``superconducting phase''. 

Simple-substance metals that exhibits superconductivity at lower temperature or under high pressure are shown in the following periodic table, where ``black-shaded'' simple substance metals show superconductivity (at lower temperature, $\blacksquare$ , while at lower temperature and under higher pressure, $\blacktriangle$ )

You might as well regard that in a sufficiently clean metal, the resistivity goes to zero at the zero-temperature, which we call ``perfect conductor'' instead of ``superconductor'', the electric conductivity diverges, so that the electric field $\mathscr{E}$ vanish inside the materials 

\noindent $(\bm{j} = \sigma \bm{E}) $

Then, the Maxwell equation tells us that the magnetic field {\uuline{subsequently}} applied after the system reach the zero-temperature will remains zero inside the material. 

\[\frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} = -c\ \text{rot}\bm{E} \]

because, during the application of the external fields, the electric field $\bm{E}$ remains zero inside the materials. 

Accordingly, both the perfect conductor at the zero-temperature and the superconductor ``expels'' the external magnetic field, when the fields are applied {\uuline{subsequently}} after the system reaches the zero-temperature. 

Remember that his is the case when the field is applied, after the temperature reaches zero-temperature. 

But, when we reduces the temperature under a finite external magnetic field, this is {\uuline{no longer}} the case for the ``perfect conductor'', while, this is still the case for the ``superconductor''. 

Namely: 

This exclusive of the magnetic field in the {\uuline{field-cooled superconductor}} s called as ``Meissner effect'', which is more essential ``\uwave{defining property}'' of superconductors than ``the zero-resistivity''. 

The ``Meissner effect'' can be understood from a phenomenological equation called London equation: 

\[\bm{j} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\bm{A} \]

where $\bm{j}$ is the current density and $\bm{A}$ is the vector potential. 

This equation can be roughly understtod by the following argument. 

In the superconductor, the electric current flow {\uuline{without any resistivity}}, so that we might as well begin with the newton's equation {\uuline{without dissipation}}: 

\[m\ddot{\bm{r}} = -e\bm{E} \]

Now that the current density is proportional to the velocity of electron

\[\bm{j} = -ne\dot{\bm{r}} \]

we might as well naively relate the time-derivative of the current with the electric field: 

\[\frac{d\bm{j}}{dt} = -\frac{ne^2}{m}\bm{E} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\frac{d\bm{A}}{dt} \]

Now that the electric field is given by the time-derivative of the vector potential, we might as well regard that the current is proportional to the vector potential

\[\bm{j} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\bm{A} \]

This London equation is, however, more or less a phenomenological equationand we will later see more microscopic derivation of this equation based on the BCS theory. 

Thereby, we will see that this equation holds true for a so-called Cooper pair, which is composed of two electrons, so that, the electron number density ``$n$'' is replaced by superelectron number density ``$n_s$''. 

\[\bm{j} = -\rho\cdot 2e \cdot\dot{\bm{r}} = -n_s e \dot{\bm{r}}\quad \text{where $\rho$ is the number of cooper pairs. } \]

In any case, this single phenomenological equation captures many important electromagnetic properties including Meissner effect. 

For example, the Meissner effect can be derived from the London equation as follows: 

From the Maxwell equation: 

\[\text{rot} \bm{B} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c}\bm{j} \]

we consider the temporally static situation: 

\[\text{rot}\bm{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c}\bm{j} = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\bm{A}^t \]

Now $\bm{B} = \text{rot}\bm{A}$, we have

\[\text{rot\ rot}\bm{B} = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\text{rot}\bm{A}^t \]
\[-\left(\nabla^2\vec{\bm{B}} - \nabla (\underset{=0}{\nabla \cdot \vec{\bm{B}}})\right) = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\vec{\bm{b}} \]

\begin{align} \tag{A}
\Rightarrow \nabla^2 \bm{B} = \frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\bm{B} = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\bm{B},\quad \lambda \equiv \sqrt{\frac{mc^2}{4\pi ne^2}} 
\end{align}

In order to solve this equation, let us consider a specific geometry of the superconducting material, so that we can define the boundary condition: 

Consider that the system is the salb geometry which has two parallel planes boundaries at $x = -L/2$ and at $x = L/2$. For simplicity, we assume that the system is infinitely large along $y,\, z$ -direction. We suppose $L$ to be very large. 

We apply the external field along $z$ direction: 

\[\begin{split}
\bm B\left(x < -\frac{L}{2}\right) &= B\hat{e}_z\\
\bm B\left(x > \frac{L}{2}\right) &= B\hat{e}_z
\end{split} \]

Now that the tangential component of $\bm{B}$ should be continuous at the two boundaries (at $x = \pm L/2$)







\section{BCS theory, Cooper pairing and Gap equation}

\subsection{BCS(Bardeen Copper Schrieffer) Hamiltonian}



Based on the experimental observation of the isotope effect, many people in 1950s had worked on the effect of electron-phonon interaction. 

As we have seen in the Section {\ref{se5-2}}, the electron-phonon coupled field theory is equivalent to the electron system with the attractive electron-electron interaction, so that we begin with the following simplified Hamiltonian called as the BCS Hamiltonian: 

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K} =& \hat{K}_0 + \hat{V} = \int d^3 \bm{x} \psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\left[\frac{1}{2m}\left(-i\hbar \nabla + \frac{e\bm{A}(\bm{x})}{c}\right)^2-\mu\right]\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
&-\frac{g}{2}\int d^3\bm{x}\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})
\end{split} \]

where $\bm{A}(\bm{x})$ is a vector potential. 

Prior to the BCS theory, Cooper had considered two-electrons problem, which are introduced into a Fermi sea and which are interacting with each other via the attractive interaction. 

Without the attractive interaction, the energy cost we need to pay forr these creations is 

\[\Delta E = \frac{\hbar k_1^2}{2m} + \frac{\hbar k_2^2}{2m}-2\mu > 0 \]

which is positive (so that the metal is stable). 

Cooper showed that, once the {\uuline{small}} attractive interaction between these two are introduced, the energy ``\uuline{cost}'' for the creating this pari of fermions near the Fermi surface becomes ``\uuline{negative}'', due to the binding energy. 

between these two particles, 

\[\Delta E = \frac{\hbar k_1^2}{2m} + \frac{\hbar k_2^2}{2m}-2\mu < 0 \]

This means that, once the attractive interaction are introduced near the Fermi surface, which is indeed the case with the ``effective'' BCS Hamiltonian, the Fermi sea (the ground state wave function for notmal metal) is \uuline{stable} toward the formations of many pairs of fermions which are bound together by the attractive interaction. 

However, Cooper also showed that a finite binding energy between the two fermions comes from the Pauli exculsion due to the background Fermi-sea state. 

Therefore, the ``true'' ground state which we would obtain from the Fermi-sea state is NOT just a pure state of many bound pairs. 

Instead, the true ground state is \uwave{a linear superposition of those states having different number of the bound pairs}. 

\begin{align}\tag{A} \label{eqA}
|\Psi\rangle = |N-\text{particle}\rangle + |(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle + |(N+4)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots + |(N+2m)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots \end{align}

Contrary to the ground state wavefunction for the normal phase, such a wave function gives a finite expection value of the squre of the creation fields: 

\[\begin{split}
\langle \Psi|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|\Psi\rangle =& \langle (N+2)-\text{particle}|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|N-\text{particle}\rangle \\ &+ \langle(N+4)-\text{particle}|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle\\ & + \cdots \neq 0 \end{split}\]

In fact, we will see that the BCS ground state wavefunction is given by this type linear superposition where each of these multiparticle states have a phase coherence

\[|\Psi\rangle = e^{i\phi_N}|N-\text{particle}\rangle + e^{i\phi_{N+2}}|(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle + e^{i\phi_{N+4}}|(N+4)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots  \]

where $\phi_M$ are \uline{not} randomly distributed in $M$. 

Based on this observation, BCS regards $\langle\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}\rangle$ (or $\langle \psi\psi\rangle$) as an order-parameter for the superconductivity, and construct the Mean-field theory for $\langle \psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}\rangle$. 

The BCS Hamiltonian reads 

\[\begin{split}\hat{K}& = \int d^3 \bm{x}\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m} - \mu\right)\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
&-\frac{1}{2} \int d^3\bm{x} \hat{\psi}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{x}) \hat{\psi}_{\beta}^{\dagger}(\bm{x}) \hat{\psi}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) \end{split}\]

where the interaction part can be rewritten into 

\[\begin{split}\psi_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}^{\dagger}(\bm{x})&\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
 &=  \left(\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle + \psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)\\
&\times \left(\langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle + \psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)
\end{split}\]

Suppose that the fluctuation from the mean-field ($\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle$) is small; we ignore the quadratic in the fluctuation: 

\[\begin{split}
\left(\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)\\
\times \left(\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right) \rightarrow 0\end{split}\]

The other terms are summarized as 

\[\begin{split}
 =&\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\\
& + \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle \end{split} \]

from which we obtain a mean-field Hamiltonian 

\[\begin{split}\hat{K}_{eff} =& \hat{K}_0 - \frac{g}{2} \int d^3 \bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) +\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) \langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle\right\} + \text{const}\\
=& \hat{K}_0 - \frac{g}{2} \int d^3 \bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x}) +\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x}) \right\} + \text{const}\\
 =&\hat{K}_0 - g\int d^3\bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x}) +\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle \right\}\\
&+g\int d^3 \bm{x} \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle \langle\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle
 \end{split}\]

In order to make the theory self-consistent, we assume that the mean-field is given by the expectation value of the product of the creation fields, \uwave{calculated with respect to the ground state wavefuynction for mean-field Hamiltonian}:

\[\langle\psi_{\downarrow}^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \equiv \langle\Phi_0|\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})|\Phi_0\rangle \]

where $|\Phi_0\rangle$ is the ground state w.f for $\hat{K}_{eff}$. 

\[
\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff}&=\int d^3\bm{x}\psi_\alpha^\dagger(\bm{x})\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla_{\bm{x}}^2}{2m}-\mu\right)\psi_\alpha(\bm{x})\\
&-g\int d^3\bm{x}\{\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \psi_\uparrow(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow(\bm{x})\\
&\quad+\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x}) \langle\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle\}\\
&+g\int d^3\bm{x}\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \underset{-\Delta(\bm{x})}{\uwave{\langle\psi_\uparrow(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow(\bm{x})\rangle}}
\end{split}
 \]

Provided that the ground state wavefunction does not break the translational symmetry spotaneously, we can regard that the mean-field does not dependes on the space coordinate. 

\[g\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \equiv-\Delta^*\equiv|\Delta|e^{-i\theta} \]

With this in mind, the mean-field Hamiltonian is readily diagonalized:

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff} &=\sum_{\bm{k}, \alpha}\left(\overset{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\frac{\hbar^2\bm{k}^2}{2m}}-\mu\right)c_{\bm{k},\alpha}^\dagger c_{\bm{k},\alpha}\\
&+\Delta^* \sum_{\bm{k}} c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}+ \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger - \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\\
&=\sum_{\bm{k}}\left\{(c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\  c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}) \left(\begin{matrix}
\xi_{\bm{k}} & -e^{i\theta}|\Delta|\\
-e^{-i\theta}|\Delta| & -\xi_{\bm{k}}
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right)+\xi_{\bm{k}}\right\}-\Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle
\end{split} \]

A unitary transformation gives

\[
\left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
\ \\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) 
= \left(\begin{matrix}
u_k & e^{i\theta}v_k\\
\ & \ \\
-e^{-i\theta}v_k & u_k
\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}\\
\ \\
\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right)  \]

with

\[
\begin{cases}
2u_{\bm{k}}v_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\\
\ & \ \\
u_{\bm{k}}^2-v_{\bm{k}}^2 &= \displaystyle\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}
\end{cases}\]

Or equivalently

\[
\begin{cases}
u_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1+\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\right)^{1/2}\\
\ & \ \\
v_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1-\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{cases}
\]

In terms of this, we have

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff}&=\sum_{\bm{k}}\left\{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger(\alpha_{\bm{k}}-\beta_{-\bm{k}}\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger)+\xi_{\bm{k}}\right\}- \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\\
&= V+\sum_{\bm{k}}\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger\alpha_{\bm{k}}+\beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger\beta_{\bm{k}}
\end{split}\]

where

\[V \equiv\sum_{\bm{k}}\{\xi_{\bm{k}}-\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}-\Delta\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\} \]

Now that $\hat{K}_{eff}$ is given by a quadrotic form in the creation fields $(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger, \beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger)$ and annihilation fields $(\alpha_{\bm{k}}, \beta_{\bm{k}})$, the eigen state of $\hat{K}_{eff}$ is given by a multi particle state of these new quastic particle. 

Noting that these fields as well as the original fields $(c_{\bm{k},\sigma}, c_{\bm{k},\sigma}^\dagger)$ are fermion fields, the eigen state is given by 

\[|(\bm{k}_1,\alpha_1),\cdots,(\bm{k}_n\beta)\rangle = \alpha_{\bm{k}_1}^\dagger \cdots \beta_{\bm{k}_n}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \]

where $|\Phi_0\rangle$ denotes the vacuum of $\alpha$-particle and $\beta$-particle (called as Bogoliubov particles). 

\[\begin{cases}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0\\
\ & \ \\
\beta_{\bm{k}}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0
\end{cases}\]

Since creating the Bogoliubov particles is always accompanied by a positive energy $(\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}>0$, the vaccum is nothing but the ground state wavefunction of $\hat{K}_{eff}$, whose energy is $V$. 

\[\hat{K}_{eff}|\Phi_0\rangle = \overset{\sum_{\bm{k}}\xi_{\bm{k}}-\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}-\Delta\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle}{\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad V}|\Phi_0\rangle \]

A group of the lowest excited states is given by ``one-particle'' state of the Budoliubov particle

\[\begin{split}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle &= |(\bm{k},\alpha\rangle\\
\beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle &= |(\bm{k}, \beta\rangle
\end{split}\]

\[\hat{K}_{eff} \alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = (V+\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2})\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \]

which is a \uline{gapped} excitation (See Fig. \ref{Fig6.3}) because of $\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}\ge|\Delta|$.

\end{figure}

This gapped behaviour of the one-particle excitation of the Bogoliubov particle is the origin of the thermal activation form of the low-temperatire specific heat in superconductors. (see later)

To see the mean-field ground state wavefunction thut introduced indeed take the form of eq. \ref{eqA}, let us construct the $|\Phi_0\rangle$ in terms of the original (electron) creation and annihilation operators: 

Now that $\alpha_{\bm{k}}$ and $\beta_{\bm{k}}$ are given by a linear combination of $c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}$ and $c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger$

\[
\left(\begin{matrix}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}\\
\ \\
\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}
u_{\bm{k}} & -e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}\\
\ & \ \\
e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}} & u_{\bm{k}}
\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
\ \\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) 
 \]

or

\[\alpha_{\bm{k}} = u_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow} - e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger \]
\[\beta_{-\bm{k}} = e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger + u_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow} \]
\[(\beta_{\bm{k}} = e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger+u_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\downarrow}) \]

This vacuum of such Bogoliubov particles given by: \footnote{This solution is derived based on guess, not rigorous calculation. The following shows some check for this solution. }

\[|\Phi_0\rangle = \prod_{\bm{k}}(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle \]

where $|vac\rangle$ denotes the vacuum of the original electrons ($c_{\bm{k}\sigma}|vac\rangle = 0$ for $\forall\ \bm{k},\sigma$) and the product over $\bm{k}$ is taken over all momentum. 

In fact, one can see that 

\[
\begin{split}
\alpha_{\bm{k}'}|\Phi_0\rangle &= \prod_{\bm{k} \neq \bm{k}'} (u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\times( u_{\bm{k}'}c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow} - e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)(u_{\bm{k}'}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle \\
&=\prod_{\bm{k}\neq\bm{k}'}(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\\
&\ \ \times (u_{\bm{k}'}^2c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}+e^{i\theta}u_{\bm{k}'}v_{\bm{k}'}(1-c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow})c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger\\
&\quad\quad -e^{i\theta}u_{\bm{k}'}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger + e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}^2c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger(c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)^2)|vac\rangle\\
&=0
\end{split}\]

Similar for applying $\beta_{\bm{k}'}$ on this and obviously derive a $0$ as well. 

Then, the many body wavefunction is given by ``a linear superposition of those states having different but even numbers of electrons''. 

\[|\Phi_0\rangle = |vac\rangle + |2-\text{particle}\rangle + |4-\text{particle}\rangle+\cdots \]

so that the expectation value of the product of two creation fields can be finite. 

To calculate $\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bf{x})^\dagger\psi_{\downarrow}(\bf{x})^\dagger\rangle$, notice first that $|\Phi_0\rangle$ is already normalized

\[\begin{split}
\langle\Phi_0|\Phi_0\rangle &= \langle vac| \prod_{\bm{k}}\{(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow})(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\}|vac\rangle\\
&= \langle vac|\prod\{u_{\bm{k}}^2+v_{\bm{k}}^2c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}\underset{=1-c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}}{c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger} c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger\}|vac\rangle\\
&=\langle vac|vac\rangle = 1
\end{split}\]

Thus the mean-field is readily calculated as follows: %Page 952

\[\begin{split}
\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\rangle &= \frac{1}{V}\int d^3 \bm{x} \langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\rangle = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\bm{k}}\langle\Phi_0|c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \\
&\quad\text{left hand side is independent of }\bm{x}\\
&= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle vac|(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow})c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger (u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle\\
&= -\frac{1}{V}e^{-i\theta}\sum_{\bm{k}}v_{\bm{k}}u_{\bm{k}}
\end{split}\]

Multuply $g$ and substitue the expressions for $u_{\bm{k}}, v_{\bm{k}}$ in terms of $\Delta$, we obtain

\[|\Delta| = \frac{g}{2}\int \frac{d^3 \bm{k}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}} \]

which is called a ``gap equation'', determing $|\Delta|$. 

Remember that the attraction interaction in the BCS Hamiltonian applies for those two electrons which are lying within an energy shell of the thickness $\hbar \omega_D$ from the Fermi surface (see previous argument).

This restriction tells us that $\hat{K}_{eff}$ with finite $|\Delta|$ holds true only for those momentum $\bm{k}$, which satisfy

\[|\xi_{\bm{k}}| \equiv |\frac{\hbar^2 \bm{k}^2}{2m}-\mu|<\hbar \omega_D \]

For the other $\bm{k}$, the off-diagonal term connecting $c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}$ and $c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}$ should be set to zero:

\[\hat{K}_{eff}=\sum_{\bm{k},\alpha}\xi_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\alpha}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\alpha}+\Delta^* \sum_{\bm{k},|\xi_{\bm{k}}|<\hbar\omega_D}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}+\Delta\sum_{\bm{k},|\xi_{\bm{k}}|<\hbar\omega_D}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger \]

which leads to

\[\begin{cases}
 (u_{\bm{k}},v_{\bm{k}}) = (1,0)\text{ for }\xi_{\bm{k}}>\hbar\omega_D\\
\ \\
(u_{\bm{k}},v_{\bm{k}}) = (0,1)\text{ for }\xi_{\bm{k}}<-\hbar\omega_D
\end{cases}\]

Thus, the right hand side acquires a cut off:

\[|\Delta|=\frac{g}{2}\underset{|\xi_{\bm{k}}|\le\hbar\omega_D}{\int}\frac{d^3 \bm{k}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}} \]
