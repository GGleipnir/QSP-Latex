\end{wrapfigure}

In a usual metal, such as alkali metals of column I, outer shell valence electrons are completely separated from their ion cores and form a nearly free electron gas. 

In the section 1-8, we have treated the positively charged ion cores as temporally-static and uniformly-distributed positively-charged background. 

Thereby, the only play role of ensuring the electrical neutrality of the whole system. 

In this section, we will study the dynamics of the positively charged backgrounds, and their effect on the electron gas. 

In real metals, the ionic background form a lattice structure, so that it is not exactly the uniformly distributed positive charges. 

But, when it comes to the acoustic mode, in which all the ion cores are moving in the same `phase', the discreet lattice structure is irrelevant and we can treat them as a positively charged continuous elastic media. 

To describe the accoustic wave, let us first define a three-dimensional vector field $\bm d$ as a function of the spatial coordinate $\bm x$, which we call displacement vector:

\[\bm{d}(\bm{x}):\quad\text{displacement vector} \]

Physically, $\bm{d(x)}$ denotes how the ionic core at position $\bm x$ is displaced:

\[\bm{u(x) - \langle u(x)\rangle \equiv d(x)} \]

Compared to the displacement field $\varphi$ introduced in section 1-4, such a quantity is characterized by three component real-valued vector in a $3$-dimensional elastic media

\[\bm{d(x) = (d_1(x),d_2(x),d_3(x))} \]

According to the Helmholtz-Hodge's decomposition theorem, any vector field in $3$0dimensional space can be decomposed into divergence-free vector and a rotation-free vector

\[\bm{d(x)} = \nabla\phi + \nabla\times\vec{\bm{A}} \]

Although we always have ambiguity when decomposing into the two, let us temporally denote the rotation-free part as $\bm{d'(x)}$ and the divergence-free parts as $\bm{d''(x)}$ so that

\[\begin{cases}
\nabla\times\bm{d'} = 0\\
\nabla\cdot\bm{d''} = 0
\end{cases}\]

Corresponding to this decomposition, the acoustic waves are composed of two different kinds. 

One is called the longitudinal acoustic wave, which is described only by the rotation-free vector field $\bm{d'}$ (To be precise, $\nabla\cdot \bm{d'} = \nabla\cdot\bm{d}$): longitudinal(compressional) acoustic wave. 

The other is called the transverse acoustic waves, which are described only by the divergence-free part $\bm{d''}$ (to be precise, $\nabla\times\bm{d''} = \nabla\times\bm{d}$): transverse(shear) acoustic waves. 

$\nabla\cdot \vec{\bm{d}}$ is nothing but the charge density modulation in a positively charged background

\[\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}} = -\frac{\delta\rho_{inoic}}{\rho_0}\]

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{5.5cm}
\includegraphics[width = 5cm]{5-2.png}
\end{wrapfigure}
One can easily see this, by drawing a configuration of the displacement vector, which has a finite divergence. 

Namely, when these ionic charges are displaced like in this picture, we have effectively a negative charge in the middle. 

On the one hand, $\nabla\times\bm{d}$ is accompanied by the shear deformation in the positively charged ionic background, e.g.,

\begin{figure}
\end{figure}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{6.5cm}
\includegraphics[width = 6cm]{5-3.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

which is not accompanied by any charge density modulation. 

Since electrons and positively charged background are coupled with each other by electrostatic Coulomb interaction, we usually regard that the longitudinal acoustic waves are strongly coupled with electrons, while the transverse waves are not. 

For this reasoning, we will focus only on the longitudinal (compressional acoustic wave, where we enforce the displacement vector is rotation-free

\[\nabla\times\vec{\bm{d}}(\bm{x},t) = 0,\forall\bm{x},t \]

In order to introduce the equation of motion for the charge density modulation

\[\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}(\bm{x},t) = \delta\rho_{ion}(\bm{x},t) \]

Let us begin with the Newton's equation of motion for a fluid element

\[\frac{D\vec{p}}{Dt} = \vec{f} \]

Here $\bm{p}(\bm{x},t)$ is the momentum density field at position $\bm{x}$ at a given time $t$ which is given by a product between mass density field and velocity field

\[\bm{p}(\bm{x},t) = \rho(\bm{x},t)\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) \]

The temporal derivative in the right hand side is a Legendre derivative often used int the course of fluid mechanics. 

\[\frac{D\bm{p}}{Dt} \overset{def}{\equiv}\lim_{\Delta\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{\Delta t} \left\{\bm{p}(\bm{x}+\bm{v}\Delta t,t+\Delta t) - \bm{p}(\bm{x},t)\right\} = \frac{\partial\bm{p}}{\partial t}+(\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)\bm{p} \]

The force acting on the fluid element is a restoring force which comes from the spatial gradient of the pressure:

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\bm{v})+(\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)(\rho\bm{v}) = -\nabla P \]

In the equilibrium, we don't have any velocity field and the mass density is uniformly distributed and static

\[\left.\begin{split}
\rho(\bm{x},t) &= \rho_0\\
\ & \ \\
\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) &= 0
\end{split}\right\}\text{\quad equilibrium} \]

Out of the equilibrium, we have finite velocity field and mass density is spatially and temporally dependent:

\[\left.\begin{split}
\rho(\bm{x},t) &= \rho_0 + \delta\rho(\bm{x},t)\\
\ & \ \\
\bm{v}(\bm{x},t) &\neq 0
\end{split}\right\}\text{\quad out of equilibrium} \]

When linearizing this equation of motion for a small derivation from the equilibrium, we can regard that the $2^{\text{nd}}$ term in the right hand side is the $2^{\text{nd}}$ order in $\delta\rho$ and thus negligible:

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left((\rho_0+\delta\rho)\bm{v}\right) + (\bm{v}\cdot\nabla)\left((\rho_0+\delta\rho)\bm{v}\right) = -\nabla P \]

\[\rho_0\frac{\partial\bm{V}}{\partial t} + {\color{red}{O((\delta\rho)^2)}}= -\nabla p \]

,\footnote{The red part is omit-able. }

In addition to this Newton's equation of motion, the mass density field and velocity field must satisfy the continuity equation: 

\[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\bm{v}) = 0 \]

When linearized with respect to a small $\delta \rho$, we have

\[\frac{\partial\delta\rho}{\partial t} = -\rho_0(\nabla\cdot\bm{v}) \]

Combining these two linearized equation, we have

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\partial t^2}= -\rho_0(\nabla\cdot\frac{\partial\vec{\bm{v}}}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 P \]

A pressure of a given fluid element is determined by the mass density of the element, so that it is quite natural to assume that the pressure depends on the spatial coordinate $\bm{x}$ only through $\rho$. 

\[\nabla^2 P = \nabla^2 P(\rho_0+\delta\rho(\bm{x},t),\cdots) \approx\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)_{\rho_0}\nabla^2\delta\rho \]

This leads to the following closed equation of motion for the density fluctuation:

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\delta t^2} = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right)_{\rho_0}\nabla^2\delta\rho \]

For many elastic continuous media, we can define (adiabatic) bulk modulus. 

\[\begin{split}
B &= -B\left(\frac{\partial O}{\partial V}\right)_{equilibrium}\\
&\quad\quad \rho = \frac{M}{V},\ \quad \frac{d\rho}{dV} = M\left(-\frac{1}{V^2}\right)\\
&= -V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)M\left(-\frac{1}{V^2}\right)\\ &= \frac{M}{V}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right)_{eq} \overset{def}{\equiv}\rho_m\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}\right)_{eq}
\end{split} \]

In terms of the bulk modulus, the coefficient of the right hand side is given by 

\[\frac{\partial^2\delta\rho}{\partial t^2} = \frac{B}{\rho_m}\cdot\nabla^2\delta\rho \equiv c^2\nabla^2\delta_\rho \]

Here $c$ is nothing but a velocity, with which the density fluctuation propagates in space as time passes by, and which is often called as the ``sound velocity'' of the longitudinal acoustic wave. 

As explained already, the density fluctuation is given by the divergence of the displacement field, the equation of motion for the displacement field is given by 

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}) = c^2\nabla^2(\nabla\cdot\vec{\bm{d}}) \]

\[\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{\partial \vec{\bm{d}}}{\partial t} - \nabla^2\vec{\bm{d}}\right) = 0 \]

Remember again that we are interested only in the longitudinal acoustic wave, so that the displacement field is rotation free at any space and time. 

\[\nabla\times\vec{\bm{d}} \equiv\vec{0} \]

The latter condition ensures that

\[\nabla\times\left(\frac{\partial \vec{\bm{d}}}{\partial t} - \nabla^2\vec{\bm{d}}\right) = 0\]

because $\nabla\times$ and $\partial_t$ or $\nabla^2$ commute with each other. 

From these two, we have a pair of equation which is satisfies by the displacement field $\bm{d}$. 

\[\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial\bm{d}}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla^2\bm{d} &= 0\\
\ &\ \\
\nabla\times\bm{d} &= 0
\end{cases}\]

So far, we just describing a classical equation of motion for the displacement field; in order to second-quantize this classical field, let us first introduce the Lagrangian which leads to this equation of motion:

\[L_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1,2,3}\int d^3\bm{x}\int dt\left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\right]\]

Notice that

\[\int \left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}\right] = \delta L_0\]
\[\rho_m\delta d_i\left[\frac{\partial^2 d_i}{\partial t^2} - c^2\sum_{j = 1,2,3}\frac{\partial^2 d_i}{\partial x_j^2}\right] = \delta L_0 \]

Under the $2$nd condition of rotation-free, the Lagrangian can be rewritten into the following:

\[L_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\int d^3\bm{x}\int dt \left[\rho_m\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial t} - B\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial d_j}{\partial x_j}\right] (=\int dt \tilde{L}_0) \]

To see this, let us begin with the following identity:

\[(\nabla\times\vec{d})\cdot(\nabla\times\vec{d}) = 0 \]

\[\epsilon_{ijk}\partial_j d_k\epsilon_{ilm}\partial_l d_m = 0 \]

\[(\delta_{il}\delta_{km} - \delta_{jm}\delta_{kl})\partial_j d_k\partial_l d_m = 0 \]

\[\sum_{i,j = 1,2,3} \partial_j d_i \partial_j d_i - \sum_{i,j}\partial_j d_i \partial_i d_j = 0 \]

Under the space integral, we can take a partial integral of the $2$nd term in the left hand side

\[\sum_{i,j}\int d^3{\bf x}[\partial_j d_i\partial_j d_i+(\partial_j\partial_i d_i)d_j] = 0 \]

\[\sum_{i,j}\int d^3{\bf x}[(\partial_j d_i)(\partial_j d_i) - (\partial_i d_i)(\partial_j d_j)] = 0 \]

The final identity allows us to rewrite this into this

\hrule

\ 

So far, we have treated the classical action. To second-quantize this classical degree's of freedom, we follow the exactly the same procedure we formulated in chapter 1. 

Namely, we first introduce a momentum variable which is conjugate the displacement field

\[\Pi_j = \frac{\delta L_0}{\delta \dot{d}_j} = \rho_m\dot{d}_j \]

Or equivalently 

\[\tilde{\Pi}_j\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho_m}}\Pi_j,\quad \tilde{d}_j\equiv\sqrt{\rho_m}d_j \]

with 

\[\tilde{\Pi}_j = \frac{\delta L_0}{\delta\dot{\tilde{d}}_j} = \dot{\tilde{d}}_j \]

Then the Hamiltonian is given by 

\[\begin{split}
H_0 &= \int d^3{\bf x}\tilde{\Pi}_j\dot{\tilde{d}}_j - \tilde{L}_0\\
 &=\frac{1}{2}\int d^3{\bf x}\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x})\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x}) + \frac{1}{2}\int d^3{\bf x}\frac{B}{\rho_m}(\nabla\cdot\tilde{\bf d}{\bf(x)})^2\\
 & \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \frac{B}{\rho_m} = c^2
\end{split}\]

To quantize these field operators we suppose that $\tilde{\bf d}(\bf x)$ and $\tilde{\Pi}(\bf x)$ are hermite operators, which satisfy the following commutation relation

\[[\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x}),\tilde{\Pi}_m({\bf x'})] = [\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf x}),\tilde{\bf d}_m({\bf x'})] = 0 \]

\[[\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf x}), \tilde{\Pi}_m({\bf x'})] = i\hbar\delta_{jm}\delta^3(\bf x-x') \]

As we did in the chapter 1, it is much useful to introduce their Fourier series:

\[\begin{cases}
\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf k}) &= \displaystyle\int d^3{\bf x}\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf x}) e^{-i\bf k\cdot x}\\
\ & \\
\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf k}) &= \displaystyle\int d^3 {\bf x} \tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x}) e^{-i\bf k\cdot x}
\end{cases}\]

where the inverse is

\[\begin{cases}
\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf x}) &= \displaystyle\int d^3{\bf k}\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf k}) e^{i\bf k\cdot k}\\
\ & \\
\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x}) &= \displaystyle\int d^3 {\bf k} \tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf k}) e^{i\bf k\cdot k}
\end{cases}\]

%page848

Since $\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf x})$ \& $\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x})$ are both Hermite operators, we have

\[\begin{cases}
\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf k}) &= \tilde{\bf d}_j({-\bf k})\\
\ & \\
\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf k}) = \tilde{\Pi}_j(-\bf k)
\end{cases}\]

In terms of these Fourier series, the Hamiltonian can be partially diagonalized. 

\[\begin{split}
\hat{H}_0 &= \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{d^3{\bf k}}{(2\pi)^3}\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf k})\tilde{\Pi}_j({-\bf k}) + \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{d^3{\bf k}}{(2\pi)^3} c^2({\bf k}_j\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf k}))({\bf k}_m\tilde{\bf d}_m(-{\bf k})\\
&=\int\frac{d^3{\bf k}}{(2\pi)^3}[\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf k})\tilde{\Pi}_j({-\bf k})+\underset{\omega_{\bf k}^2}{c^2{\bf k}^2}(\hat{\bf k}_j\tilde{\bf d}_j({\bf k}))(\hat{\bf k}_m\tilde{\bf d}_m(-{\bf k}))
\end{split}\]

where $\hat{\bf k}_j \equiv {\bf k}_j/k,\quad k\equiv|\bf k|$. 

Note that

\[\tilde{\Pi}_j({\bf x}) = \partial_t\tilde{\bf d}_j(\bf x) \]

So that the conjugate momentum as well as the displacement field is rotation free,

\section{Electron-phonon interaction} \label{se5-2}

So far, we have studied how the acoustic waves are second-quantized into a quadratic boson Hamiltonian. We next study the interaction between the longitudinal acoustic phonon and electron




\chapter{Application to superconductivity}


In this chapter, we will study superconductivity which is one of the most remarkable physical phenomenon.

We first review the fundamental physical properties of superconductors.

We then introduce the BCS theory, which is one of the most successful application of quantum many-body techniques.

In terms of the BCS theory, we will see how all the fundamental superconducting properties can be understood from the microscopic point of views.



\section{Superconducting properties and thermodynamics relations}


Resistivity in metals decreases when the temperature goes down (See Fig{\ref{Fig6.1}}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{6-1.png}\label{Fig6.1}\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{6-2.png}\label{Fig6.2}
\caption{Resistivity $\rho$ vs. Temperature $T$ by $\rho = \rho_{res} + aT^2$ where `res' denotes residual resistivity. } \caption{Resistivity of superconductor's $\rho$ vs. Temperature $T$ by $\rho = \rho_{res} + aT^2$ where `res' denotes residual resistivity. } 
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The temperature dependence always exhibits $T^2$ behavior while the resistivity at the zero temperature remains finite, which we call residual resistivity $\rho_{res}$.
    
This residual resistivity stems from the scattering of conduction electron due to randomly distributed impurity and lattice defects. 
    
On the other hand, $T^2$-dependence of the resistivity comes from the scattering of conduction electrons due to electron-phonon interaction and electron-electron interactions. 
    
But, in some cases, metals exhibits an electronic phase transition at lower temperatures and resistivity becomes zero. 

The low-temperature phase with zero resistivity is called superconductor, or ``superconducting phase''. 

Simple-substance metals that exhibits superconductivity at lower temperature or under high pressure are shown in the following periodic table, where ``black-shaded'' simple substance metals show superconductivity (at lower temperature, $\blacksquare$ , while at lower temperature and under higher pressure, $\blacktriangle$ )

You might as well regard that in a sufficiently clean metal, the resistivity goes to zero at the zero-temperature, which we call ``perfect conductor'' instead of ``superconductor'', the electric conductivity diverges, so that the electric field $\mathscr{E}$ vanish inside the materials 

\noindent $(\bm{j} = \sigma \bm{E}) $

Then, the Maxwell equation tells us that the magnetic field {\uuline{subsequently}} applied after the system reach the zero-temperature will remains zero inside the material. 

\[\frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} = -c\ \text{rot}\bm{E} \]

because, during the application of the external fields, the electric field $\bm{E}$ remains zero inside the materials. 

Accordingly, both the perfect conductor at the zero-temperature and the superconductor ``expels'' the external magnetic field, when the fields are applied {\uuline{subsequently}} after the system reaches the zero-temperature. 

Remember that his is the case when the field is applied, after the temperature reaches zero-temperature. 

But, when we reduces the temperature under a finite external magnetic field, this is {\uuline{no longer}} the case for the ``perfect conductor'', while, this is still the case for the ``superconductor''. 

Namely: 

This exclusive of the magnetic field in the {\uuline{field-cooled superconductor}} s called as ``Meissner effect'', which is more essential ``\uwave{defining property}'' of superconductors than ``the zero-resistivity''. 

The ``Meissner effect'' can be understood from a phenomenological equation called London equation: 

\[\bm{j} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\bm{A} \]

where $\bm{j}$ is the current density and $\bm{A}$ is the vector potential. 

This equation can be roughly understtod by the following argument. 

In the superconductor, the electric current flow {\uuline{without any resistivity}}, so that we might as well begin with the newton's equation {\uuline{without dissipation}}: 

\[m\ddot{\bm{r}} = -e\bm{E} \]

Now that the current density is proportional to the velocity of electron

\[\bm{j} = -ne\dot{\bm{r}} \]

we might as well naively relate the time-derivative of the current with the electric field: 

\[\frac{d\bm{j}}{dt} = -\frac{ne^2}{m}\bm{E} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\frac{d\bm{A}}{dt} \]

Now that the electric field is given by the time-derivative of the vector potential, we might as well regard that the current is proportional to the vector potential

\[\bm{j} = -\frac{ne^2}{mc}\bm{A} \]

This London equation is, however, more or less a phenomenological equationand we will later see more microscopic derivation of this equation based on the BCS theory. 

Thereby, we will see that this equation holds true for a so-called Cooper pair, which is composed of two electrons, so that, the electron number density ``$n$'' is replaced by superelectron number density ``$n_s$''. 

\[\bm{j} = -\rho\cdot 2e \cdot\dot{\bm{r}} = -n_s e \dot{\bm{r}}\quad \text{where $\rho$ is the number of cooper pairs. } \]

In any case, this single phenomenological equation captures many important electromagnetic properties including Meissner effect. 

For example, the Meissner effect can be derived from the London equation as follows: 

From the Maxwell equation: 

\[\text{rot} \bm{B} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c}\bm{j} \]

we consider the temporally static situation: 

\[\text{rot}\bm{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c}\bm{j} = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\bm{A}^t \]

Now $\bm{B} = \text{rot}\bm{A}$, we have

\[\text{rot\ rot}\bm{B} = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\text{rot}\bm{A}^t \]
\[-\left(\nabla^2\vec{\bm{B}} - \nabla (\underset{=0}{\nabla \cdot \vec{\bm{B}}})\right) = -\frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\vec{\bm{b}} \]

\begin{align} \tag{A}
\Rightarrow \nabla^2 \bm{B} = \frac{4\pi ne^2}{mc^2}\bm{B} = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\bm{B},\quad \lambda \equiv \sqrt{\frac{mc^2}{4\pi ne^2}} 
\end{align}

In order to solve this equation, let us consider a specific geometry of the superconducting material, so that we can define the boundary condition: 

Consider that the system is the salb geometry which has two parallel planes boundaries at $x = -L/2$ and at $x = L/2$. For simplicity, we assume that the system is infinitely large along $y,\, z$ -direction. We suppose $L$ to be very large. 

We apply the external field along $z$ direction: 

\[\begin{split}
\bm B\left(x < -\frac{L}{2}\right) &= B\hat{e}_z\\
\bm B\left(x > \frac{L}{2}\right) &= B\hat{e}_z
\end{split} \]

Now that the tangential component of $\bm{B}$ should be continuous at the two boundaries (at $x = \pm L/2$)







\section{BCS theory, Cooper pairing and Gap equation}

\subsection{BCS(Bardeen Copper Schrieffer) Hamiltonian}



Based on the experimental observation of the isotope effect, many people in 1950s had worked on the effect of electron-phonon interaction. 

As we have seen in the Section {\ref{se5-2}}, the electron-phonon coupled field theory is equivalent to the electron system with the attractive electron-electron interaction, so that we begin with the following simplified Hamiltonian called as the BCS Hamiltonian: 

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K} =& \hat{K}_0 + \hat{V} = \int d^3 \bm{x} \psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\left[\frac{1}{2m}\left(-i\hbar \nabla + \frac{e\bm{A}(\bm{x})}{c}\right)^2-\mu\right]\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
&-\frac{g}{2}\int d^3\bm{x}\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})
\end{split} \]

where $\bm{A}(\bm{x})$ is a vector potential. 

Prior to the BCS theory, Cooper had considered two-electrons problem, which are introduced into a Fermi sea and which are interacting with each other via the attractive interaction. 

Without the attractive interaction, the energy cost we need to pay forr these creations is 

\[\Delta E = \frac{\hbar k_1^2}{2m} + \frac{\hbar k_2^2}{2m}-2\mu > 0 \]

which is positive (so that the metal is stable). 

Cooper showed that, once the {\uuline{small}} attractive interaction between these two are introduced, the energy ``\uuline{cost}'' for the creating this pari of fermions near the Fermi surface becomes ``\uuline{negative}'', due to the binding energy. 

between these two particles, 

\[\Delta E = \frac{\hbar k_1^2}{2m} + \frac{\hbar k_2^2}{2m}-2\mu < 0 \]

This means that, once the attractive interaction are introduced near the Fermi surface, which is indeed the case with the ``effective'' BCS Hamiltonian, the Fermi sea (the ground state wave function for notmal metal) is \uuline{stable} toward the formations of many pairs of fermions which are bound together by the attractive interaction. 

However, Cooper also showed that a finite binding energy between the two fermions comes from the Pauli exculsion due to the background Fermi-sea state. 

Therefore, the ``true'' ground state which we would obtain from the Fermi-sea state is NOT just a pure state of many bound pairs. 

Instead, the true ground state is \uwave{a linear superposition of those states having different number of the bound pairs}. 

\begin{align}\tag{A} \label{eqA}
|\Psi\rangle = |N-\text{particle}\rangle + |(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle + |(N+4)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots + |(N+2m)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots \end{align}

Contrary to the ground state wavefunction for the normal phase, such a wave function gives a finite expection value of the squre of the creation fields: 

\[\begin{split}
\langle \Psi|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|\Psi\rangle =& \langle (N+2)-\text{particle}|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|N-\text{particle}\rangle \\ &+ \langle(N+4)-\text{particle}|\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}|(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle\\ & + \cdots \neq 0 \end{split}\]

In fact, we will see that the BCS ground state wavefunction is given by this type linear superposition where each of these multiparticle states have a phase coherence

\[|\Psi\rangle = e^{i\phi_N}|N-\text{particle}\rangle + e^{i\phi_{N+2}}|(N+2)-\text{particle}\rangle + e^{i\phi_{N+4}}|(N+4)-\text{particle}\rangle + \cdots  \]

where $\phi_M$ are \uline{not} randomly distributed in $M$. 

Based on this observation, BCS regards $\langle\psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}\rangle$ (or $\langle \psi\psi\rangle$) as an order-parameter for the superconductivity, and construct the Mean-field theory for $\langle \psi^{\dagger}\psi^{\dagger}\rangle$. 

The BCS Hamiltonian reads 

\[\begin{split}\hat{K}& = \int d^3 \bm{x}\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m} - \mu\right)\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
&-\frac{1}{2} \int d^3\bm{x} \hat{\psi}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{x}) \hat{\psi}_{\beta}^{\dagger}(\bm{x}) \hat{\psi}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) \end{split}\]

where the interaction part can be rewritten into 

\[\begin{split}\psi_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}^{\dagger}(\bm{x})&\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\\
 &=  \left(\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle + \psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)\\
&\times \left(\langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle + \psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)
\end{split}\]

Suppose that the fluctuation from the mean-field ($\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle$) is small; we ignore the quadratic in the fluctuation: 

\[\begin{split}
\left(\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right)\\
\times \left(\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\right) \rightarrow 0\end{split}\]

The other terms are summarized as 

\[\begin{split}
 =&\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\\
& + \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x}) - \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\langle\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle \end{split} \]

from which we obtain a mean-field Hamiltonian 

\[\begin{split}\hat{K}_{eff} =& \hat{K}_0 - \frac{g}{2} \int d^3 \bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x}) +\psi^{\dagger}_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\beta}(\bm{x}) \langle\psi_{\beta}(\bm{x})\psi_{\alpha}(\bm{x})\rangle\right\} + \text{const}\\
=& \hat{K}_0 - \frac{g}{2} \int d^3 \bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x}) +\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x}) \right\} + \text{const}\\
 =&\hat{K}_0 - g\int d^3\bm{x} \left\{\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x}) +\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle \right\}\\
&+g\int d^3 \bm{x} \langle\psi^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\psi^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\rangle \langle\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})\rangle
 \end{split}\]

In order to make the theory self-consistent, we assume that the mean-field is given by the expectation value of the product of the creation fields, \uwave{calculated with respect to the ground state wavefuynction for mean-field Hamiltonian}:

\[\langle\psi_{\downarrow}^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \equiv \langle\Phi_0|\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})|\Phi_0\rangle \]

where $|\Phi_0\rangle$ is the ground state w.f for $\hat{K}_{eff}$. 

\[
\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff}&=\int d^3\bm{x}\psi_\alpha^\dagger(\bm{x})\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla_{\bm{x}}^2}{2m}-\mu\right)\psi_\alpha(\bm{x})\\
&-g\int d^3\bm{x}\{\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \psi_\uparrow(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow(\bm{x})\\
&\quad+\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x}) \langle\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle\}\\
&+g\int d^3\bm{x}\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \underset{-\Delta(\bm{x})}{\uwave{\langle\psi_\uparrow(\bm{x})\psi_\downarrow(\bm{x})\rangle}}
\end{split}
 \]

Provided that the ground state wavefunction does not break the translational symmetry spotaneously, we can regard that the mean-field does not dependes on the space coordinate. 

\[g\langle\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\bm{x})\rangle \equiv-\Delta^*\equiv|\Delta|e^{-i\theta} \]

With this in mind, the mean-field Hamiltonian is readily diagonalized:

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff} &=\sum_{\bm{k}, \alpha}\left(\overset{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\frac{\hbar^2\bm{k}^2}{2m}}-\mu\right)c_{\bm{k},\alpha}^\dagger c_{\bm{k},\alpha}\\
&+\Delta^* \sum_{\bm{k}} c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}+ \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger - \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\\
&=\sum_{\bm{k}}\left\{(c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\  c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}) \left(\begin{matrix}
\xi_{\bm{k}} & -e^{i\theta}|\Delta|\\
-e^{-i\theta}|\Delta| & -\xi_{\bm{k}}
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right)+\xi_{\bm{k}}\right\}-\Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle
\end{split} \]

A unitary transformation gives

\[
\left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
\ \\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) 
= \left(\begin{matrix}
u_k & e^{i\theta}v_k\\
\ & \ \\
-e^{-i\theta}v_k & u_k
\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}\\
\ \\
\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right)  \]

with

\[
\begin{cases}
2u_{\bm{k}}v_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\\
\ & \ \\
u_{\bm{k}}^2-v_{\bm{k}}^2 &= \displaystyle\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}
\end{cases}\]

Or equivalently

\[
\begin{cases}
u_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1+\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\right)^{1/2}\\
\ & \ \\
v_{\bm{k}} &= \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1-\frac{\xi_{\bm{k}}}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{cases}
\]

In terms of this, we have

\[\begin{split}
\hat{K}_{eff}&=\sum_{\bm{k}}\left\{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger(\alpha_{\bm{k}}-\beta_{-\bm{k}}\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger)+\xi_{\bm{k}}\right\}- \Delta\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\\
&= V+\sum_{\bm{k}}\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger\alpha_{\bm{k}}+\beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger\beta_{\bm{k}}
\end{split}\]

where

\[V \equiv\sum_{\bm{k}}\{\xi_{\bm{k}}-\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}-\Delta\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle\} \]

Now that $\hat{K}_{eff}$ is given by a quadrotic form in the creation fields $(\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger, \beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger)$ and annihilation fields $(\alpha_{\bm{k}}, \beta_{\bm{k}})$, the eigen state of $\hat{K}_{eff}$ is given by a multi particle state of these new quastic particle. 

Noting that these fields as well as the original fields $(c_{\bm{k},\sigma}, c_{\bm{k},\sigma}^\dagger)$ are fermion fields, the eigen state is given by 

\[|(\bm{k}_1,\alpha_1),\cdots,(\bm{k}_n\beta)\rangle = \alpha_{\bm{k}_1}^\dagger \cdots \beta_{\bm{k}_n}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \]

where $|\Phi_0\rangle$ denotes the vacuum of $\alpha$-particle and $\beta$-particle (called as Bogoliubov particles). 

\[\begin{cases}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0\\
\ & \ \\
\beta_{\bm{k}}|\Phi_0\rangle &= 0
\end{cases}\]

Since creating the Bogoliubov particles is always accompanied by a positive energy $(\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}>0$, the vaccum is nothing but the ground state wavefunction of $\hat{K}_{eff}$, whose energy is $V$. 

\[\hat{K}_{eff}|\Phi_0\rangle = \overset{\sum_{\bm{k}}\xi_{\bm{k}}-\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}-\Delta\langle c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger\rangle}{\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad V}|\Phi_0\rangle \]

A group of the lowest excited states is given by ``one-particle'' state of the Budoliubov particle

\[\begin{split}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle &= |(\bm{k},\alpha\rangle\\
\beta_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle &= |(\bm{k}, \beta\rangle
\end{split}\]

\[\hat{K}_{eff} \alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = (V+\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2})\alpha_{\bm{k}}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \]

which is a \uline{gapped} excitation (See Fig. \ref{Fig6.3}) because of $\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}\ge|\Delta|$.

\end{figure}

This gapped behaviour of the one-particle excitation of the Bogoliubov particle is the origin of the thermal activation form of the low-temperatire specific heat in superconductors. (see later)

To see the mean-field ground state wavefunction thut introduced indeed take the form of eq. \ref{eqA}, let us construct the $|\Phi_0\rangle$ in terms of the original (electron) creation and annihilation operators: 

Now that $\alpha_{\bm{k}}$ and $\beta_{\bm{k}}$ are given by a linear combination of $c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}$ and $c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger$

\[
\left(\begin{matrix}
\alpha_{\bm{k}}\\
\ \\
\beta_{-\bm{k}}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}
u_{\bm{k}} & -e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}\\
\ & \ \\
e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}} & u_{\bm{k}}
\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
\ \\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger
\end{matrix}\right) 
 \]

or

\[\alpha_{\bm{k}} = u_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow} - e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger \]
\[\beta_{-\bm{k}} = e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger + u_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow} \]
\[(\beta_{\bm{k}} = e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger+u_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\downarrow}) \]

This vacuum of such Bogoliubov particles given by: \footnote{This solution is derived based on guess, not rigorous calculation. The following shows some check for this solution. }

\[|\Phi_0\rangle = \prod_{\bm{k}}(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle \]

where $|vac\rangle$ denotes the vacuum of the original electrons ($c_{\bm{k}\sigma}|vac\rangle = 0$ for $\forall\ \bm{k},\sigma$) and the product over $\bm{k}$ is taken over all momentum. 

In fact, one can see that 

\[
\begin{split}
\alpha_{\bm{k}'}|\Phi_0\rangle &= \prod_{\bm{k} \neq \bm{k}'} (u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\times( u_{\bm{k}'}c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow} - e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)(u_{\bm{k}'}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle \\
&=\prod_{\bm{k}\neq\bm{k}'}(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\\
&\ \ \times (u_{\bm{k}'}^2c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}+e^{i\theta}u_{\bm{k}'}v_{\bm{k}'}(1-c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow})c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger\\
&\quad\quad -e^{i\theta}u_{\bm{k}'}v_{\bm{k}'}c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger + e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}'}^2c_{\bm{k}'\uparrow}^\dagger(c_{-\bm{k}'\downarrow}^\dagger)^2)|vac\rangle\\
&=0
\end{split}\]

Similar for applying $\beta_{\bm{k}'}$ on this and obviously derive a $0$ as well. 

Then, the many body wavefunction is given by ``a linear superposition of those states having different but even numbers of electrons''. 

\[|\Phi_0\rangle = |vac\rangle + |2-\text{particle}\rangle + |4-\text{particle}\rangle+\cdots \]

so that the expectation value of the product of two creation fields can be finite. 

To calculate $\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bf{x})^\dagger\psi_{\downarrow}(\bf{x})^\dagger\rangle$, notice first that $|\Phi_0\rangle$ is already normalized

\[\begin{split}
\langle\Phi_0|\Phi_0\rangle &= \langle vac| \prod_{\bm{k}}\{(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow})(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)\}|vac\rangle\\
&= \langle vac|\prod\{u_{\bm{k}}^2+v_{\bm{k}}^2c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}\underset{=1-c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}}{c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger} c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger\}|vac\rangle\\
&=\langle vac|vac\rangle = 1
\end{split}\]

Thus the mean-field is readily calculated as follows: %Page 952

\[\begin{split}
\langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\rangle &= \frac{1}{V}\int d^3 \bm{x} \langle\psi_{\downarrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\psi_{\uparrow}(\bm{x})^\dagger\rangle = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\bm{k}}\langle\Phi_0|c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle \\
&\quad\text{left hand side is independent of }\bm{x}\\
&= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\bm{k}}\langle vac|(u_{\bm{k}}+e^{-i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow})c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger (u_{\bm{k}}+e^{i\theta}v_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger)|vac\rangle\\
&= -\frac{1}{V}e^{-i\theta}\sum_{\bm{k}}v_{\bm{k}}u_{\bm{k}}
\end{split}\]

Multuply $g$ and substitue the expressions for $u_{\bm{k}}, v_{\bm{k}}$ in terms of $\Delta$, we obtain

\[|\Delta| = \frac{g}{2}\int \frac{d^3 \bm{k}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}} \]

which is called a ``gap equation'', determing $|\Delta|$. 

Remember that the attraction interaction in the BCS Hamiltonian applies for those two electrons which are lying within an energy shell of the thickness $\hbar \omega_D$ from the Fermi surface (see previous argument).

This restriction tells us that $\hat{K}_{eff}$ with finite $|\Delta|$ holds true only for those momentum $\bm{k}$, which satisfy

\[|\xi_{\bm{k}}| \equiv |\frac{\hbar^2 \bm{k}^2}{2m}-\mu|<\hbar \omega_D \]

For the other $\bm{k}$, the off-diagonal term connecting $c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}$ and $c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}$ should be set to zero:

\[\hat{K}_{eff}=\sum_{\bm{k},\alpha}\xi_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\alpha}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\alpha}+\Delta^* \sum_{\bm{k},|\xi_{\bm{k}}|<\hbar\omega_D}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}+\Delta\sum_{\bm{k},|\xi_{\bm{k}}|<\hbar\omega_D}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^\dagger \]

which leads to

\[\begin{cases}
 (u_{\bm{k}},v_{\bm{k}}) = (1,0)\text{ for }\xi_{\bm{k}}>\hbar\omega_D\\
\ \\
(u_{\bm{k}},v_{\bm{k}}) = (0,1)\text{ for }\xi_{\bm{k}}<-\hbar\omega_D
\end{cases}\]

Thus, the right hand side acquires a cut off:

\[|\Delta|=\frac{g}{2}\underset{|\xi_{\bm{k}}|\le\hbar\omega_D}{\int}\frac{d^3 \bm{k}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|\Delta|}{\sqrt{\xi_{\bm{k}}^2+|\Delta|^2}} \]
