## 1. What's this project

This project, as you can see from the disclaimer part of the pdf file, works for latexify Prof. Shindou's lecture notes so that students of that course can read more comfortable. 

## 2. Who works for this?

This file is finished by 4 students, whose name is shown in the last part of the lecture notes. 

## 3. How should I use this?

Actually it's quite simple 'cuz you can directly download it from the root: the file ``All.pdf'' is all you need to read. 

## 4. How to report errors? 

Well, you can send emails but I personally doesn't suggest you to do so. Please check where the original file went wrong, and leave a message at this github page. If you're interested in this, you can also fork this project, which have all the necessary .tex file (but without figures). You can amend the .tex file and push it to this. I would merge the newest version. 

## 5. Do we have another material about QSP? 

That's a good question. Last year's material and some latrxify homeworks can be seen here
